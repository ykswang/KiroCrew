 * persona content they saw). The backend does the content-binding check: it
 * injects the persona only if this token equals sha256 of the persona.md it
 * reads, so a re-install that swaps persona.md (new sha) does not match the
 * stale grant and the never-consented persona is never injected.
 *
 * Installed/custom packs are keyed `custom-<slug>` in colorTheme (useTheme), so
 * slice(7) drops the `custom-` prefix to recover the slug. Returns null (field
 * omitted from the body) when there's nothing transmittable: no colorTheme, a
