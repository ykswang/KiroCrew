# Security Module

## Overview

KiroCrew implements defense-in-depth security across multiple layers: OS-level process isolation, credential path protection, input/output validation, authentication, authorization, and audit logging. This document consolidates all security controls and the vulnerabilities they address.

## Threat Model

| Threat | Vector | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|------------|
| XPIA credential theft | LLM reads `~/.aws`, `~/.ssh` via `fs_read` or `cat` | Hook-layer path blocking + OS sandbox |
| XPIA data exfiltration | LLM embeds secrets in URLs posted to a chat channel or the dashboard | Output scanning + URL redaction |
| Cross-origin WebSocket hijack | Malicious page connects to `ws://127.0.0.1:5476/api/ws` | Origin header validation |
| Cross-origin mutation (CSRF) | Malicious page POSTs to dashboard API | Origin/Referer validation on non-safe methods |
| DNS rebinding | Attacker domain resolves to `127.0.0.1`; browser sends forged `Host` to the loopback-bound dashboard (incl. GET exfil) | `Host`-header allowlist validation on every method (`check_host` / `host_validation_middleware`), deny-by-default, 403 + SEL audit. Sole exemption: the three `PROBE_PATHS` liveness probes (orchestrators address containers by IP); their handlers strip identity fields via a second `check_host` gate, leaking nothing beyond TCP reachability |
| Unauthenticated remote access | Dashboard bound to `0.0.0.0` | Loopback-only by default (`127.0.0.1`); when user opts in via `dashboard.url`, token auth middleware requires HMAC-SHA256 signed, IP-pinned, single-use tokens on every request |
| Unauthenticated remote access (AEA tunnel) | `tunnel.enabled` exposes dashboard via public HTTPS URL | Double auth: Tunnels validates Midway OIDC at edge + KiroCrew token auth middleware. Security gate refuses tunnel start without token auth active. Owner-only access (Tunnels restricts by username). SEL audit on connect/disconnect/denial |
| Unauthorized dashboard access | No auth on localhost | Token auth middleware on all requests (loopback bypass removed); file-based IPC secret for internal paths |
| Non-owner channel interaction | Any workspace/server member clicks YOLO/approve buttons | 5-layer owner verification |
| Fail-open owner lock | `KIROCREW_OWNER_ID` unset → no check | Deny-by-default: refuse connect + reject messages |
| MCP input injection | Malformed/oversized tool inputs from LLM | Centralized schema validation (`validation.py`) |
| MCP response DoS | Unbounded tool output fills memory | Response truncation at 100K |
| Destructive CLI commands | LLM runs `rm -rf /`, `git push --force` | 130 built-in denied-command rules (`BUILTIN_DENIED_RULES`, default-on / user-disableable) enforced at the hooks PreToolUse gate + governance `commands` force-deny (enterprise, un-opt-out-able) + 55 suspicious bash patterns with per-segment matching (`security.py`) |
| Node-path trust-root rewrite | Prompt-injected shell rewrites `node-bin-dir`, then Browser Mode runs its fake `npx` outside the agent sandbox | `node-bin-dir` is on the read/write sensitive-path floor; changing it requires an explicit operator action outside the agent tool path |
| Frontend XSS | `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with unsanitized content | DOMPurify + safe DOM APIs + Mermaid `securityLevel: 'strict'` (iframe sandbox) |
| Widget postMessage forged turn | LLM-emitted `<script>` in a sandboxed `<mcwidget>` iframe calls `parent.postMessage({type:'mc-widget-action'})`, bypassing the in-iframe `isTrusted` click guard | Frontend requires a human gesture: a widget action only PRE-FILLS the composer (never auto-submits) and tags the resulting user-initiated send `meta.origin='widget'`. Backend deny-by-default: `api_chat` refuses the sole chat-text-reachable privilege escalation — orchestrator `go`/`go all` auto-run — for `origin='widget'` turns (SEL `auto_run_denied`), letting the text fall through to a normal fully-gated turn. Mode changes and tool approvals are on separate endpoints the iframe cannot reach |
| YOLO mode abuse | Unbounded auto-approve window | Time-limited safety override: Slack 30min, dashboard 6h, config 24h (no permanent mode). Re-auth required after expiry. SEL audit on every lifecycle event |
| Trust reads bypass | Read-only command classification tricked into approving writes | Deny-by-default: rejects redirections, command substitutions, newline separator bypasses. Prefix matching only |
| Port-forward auth bypass | socat/ssh -R makes remote traffic appear as 127.0.0.1 | Loopback bypass removed; all requests require token auth. File-based IPC secret for internal paths |
| Observe-mode context poisoning | Non-owner messages in shared channels influence LLM context | `channel_history.push` gated on `_user_authorized` |
| Outbound data exfiltration | LLM exfils data via `curl -d @file`, `nc < file` | Data-egress/reverse-shell command shapes (`_BASH_EXFIL_PATTERNS` / `audit_bash_exfiltration()`) are **denied at the tool-invocation gate** (`hooks.on_tool_call` + `mcp_cron`), not only advisory-audited (commit 5682f92b); + `redact_exfiltration_urls()` on output |
| Credential file permissions | `.env` readable by group/other | `chmod 600` enforced at credential load time + setup wizard |
| SEL event forwarding leaks | Forwarded audit events contain raw credentials | `redact()` applied to all string fields before callback |
| Foreign-agent import widens trust | A local Codex/Claude Code/MeshClaw/OpenClaw/Hermes config contains credentials, hooks, personas, instructions, unsafe paths, or permissive runtime/security settings | Authenticated scan/apply/state APIs + fixed source/category catalogs + secret-free projections + native destination validation + merge-only writes; unsupported/secret items are reported, source trees remain untouched, and governance cannot be imported or widened |
| Unsigned/unadmitted app install | Malicious app installs/registers via CLI, registry, or `POST /api/apps/register` with no admission control (`register_external_app` writes `enabled=True`) | Contained App Kit admission gate (`apps/admission.py`) on install/update/enable/register/registry — kill-switch `banned` (always wins) + `approved` allowlist + optional HMAC `require_signature`, fail-closed on an unreadable `app_admission.json`; absent policy admits (interim default) |
| Implicit third-party app execution | An installed app reaches Python hooks, backend spawn, lifecycle/install shell scripts, or `openCommand` without explicit operator consent; a disabled app invokes `openCommand` | Central `apps/execution.py` decision defaults deny, accepts only JSON boolean `agent.apps_allow_third_party=true`, exempts positively identified builtins, fails closed on config errors, gates every execution chokepoint before side effects, requires enabled state for open, and SEL-audits denials |
| App manifest path traversal | `backend.entryPoint`/`agents`/`skills`/`sops`/`ui.entry` uses `..` or an absolute path to escape the app root | `AppManifest.validate(app_root=...)` canonical containment (resolve + `is_relative_to`) + absolute-path rejection at install/discovery; runtime backstop in `apps/backend.py` rejects an `entryPoint` that resolves outside the app root at boot |
| App over-privilege (advisory-only manifest model) | Malicious/buggy app exceeds its declared manifest `permissions` (extra `mcpTools`, `network`, `shared` memory) | **Advisory today** — `apps/permissions.py:validate_permissions`/`format_permissions_summary` are unwired (only exercised by tests), `check_tool_permission` fails open on empty allowlist; real confinement is the HTTP app-token scope (`token_auth.py`, CWE-269) + OS sandbox, plus the `agent.apps_allow_third_party` off-switch; in-process capability gating tracked in `app-sandbox-roadmap.md` (TRACKING) |
| Plaintext-transport registry MITM (CWE-319) | A federated registry added over `http://` lets a network attacker swap the fetched index + app manifests, whose setup code later runs with gateway privileges (signatures optional by default) | `_SAFE_HTTPS_URL_RE` in `apps/routes.py` accepts **`https://` only** (plaintext `http://` rejected); private remotes use an explicit `ssh://`/scp form. `POST /api/apps/registries` validates every `repo` through `_is_safe_repo_identifier` (bare name **or** vetted git URL — shell metacharacters / traversal / owner/repo shorthand rejected) |
| Registry-index SSRF via injected clone host (CWE-918) | An untrusted external registry index lists an app whose `repo` points at a loopback/internal address (e.g. `https://127.0.0.1:8443/x`); the App Store browse/refresh/install path clones automatically, driving `git clone` against the internal network (authenticated backend SSRF; DNS-rebinding-capable) | `is_clone_host_trusted` (`apps/registry.py`) fails **closed**, constraining every URL clone to a **host** in the public-forge ∪ configured-registry trust set, enforced at all three clone chokepoints (`_fetch_git_blob`, `_fetch_app_manifest`, `_git_clone_or_pull`). Gates on hostname not IP → rebinding-proof. Host-level SSRF defense, **not** a supply-chain control (admission/signature gate is the orthogonal second layer) |
| Registry-index path traversal via entry name (CWE-22) | A hostile/typo index entry `name` (`/tmp/victim`, `../../victim`) flows to `app_source_dir(name)` and, on a failed clone, `shutil.rmtree(dest)` on the attacker-selected path | Every index entry name is validated against `KEBAB_RE` during normalization and **dropped before it is cached or listed** (warning-logged only); non-string / non-kebab names never reach a filesystem operation |

## Modules

### OS-Level Sandbox (`sandbox.py`)

Hides credential paths from kiro-cli subprocess tree using platform-native isolation:

- **Linux**: user + mount namespace — `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)` → identity UID/GID map → `unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)` → bind-mount empty dirs. Availability is decided **empirically** by `_probe_unshare_once()`, which performs this **exact split sequence** rather than a combined `unshare(NEWUSER|NEWNS)` — see "Linux capability probe mirrors the split sequence" below for why the combined form gives a false positive.
- **macOS**: `sandbox-exec` with Seatbelt profile denying file reads. Backend availability is decided **empirically** by `_probe_sandbox_exec()` (write an `(allow default)` profile, run `sandbox-exec -f <profile>` against a trusted fixed system binary — `/usr/bin/true`, never the user-writable kiro-cli — and require exit 0) — there is **no hard-coded OS-version cutoff**. macOS 26 (Tahoe) is fully supported: Seatbelt is the same kernel subsystem backing App Sandbox/iOS/Chromium and was not removed; an earlier `major >= 26 → return False` gate wrongly disabled a working sandbox and was removed (verified the real profile compiles, runs a sandboxed process, and enforces credential-path denies on macOS 26.5). The `(allow default)` + targeted-deny profile also sidesteps the `(deny default)` sysctl-allowlist pitfall that caused the false "sandbox broken on macOS 26" reports.

#### Sandbox Modes

| Mode | Config value | Hides | Accessible | Env scrub |
|------|-------------|-------|------------|-----------|
| **Standard** | `"auto"` (default) | `.gnupg`, `.gpg`, `.config/gcloud`, `.azure`, `.docker` | `.aws`, `.ssh`, `.kube` | `AWS_SECRET*`, `AWS_SESSION*`, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, `GNUPGHOME`, `GIT_ASKPASS` |
| **Strict** | `"strict"` | All of the above + `.aws`, `.ssh`, `.kube` | Only `~/.ssh/known_hosts` | Same as standard |
| **Off** | `"off"` | Nothing | Everything | Nothing |

**Standard mode** (new default) enables git-over-SSH, AWS CLI via `credential_process`, and kubectl while maintaining OS-level isolation on non-workflow credential stores. Env vars are scrubbed in ALL modes — `credential_process` reads from `~/.aws/config`, not env vars.

**Pooled-backend declared-env forwarding (`mcp_gateway.forward_declared_env`, default OFF)** — an agent spec may declare `mcpServers.<name>.env`. Under pooling one backend serves many sessions, so the rewriter writes that block to a `0600` sidecar and the stub folds it into the `effective_env_hash` PoolKey dimension; historically it was never applied to the shared backend at all. With the flag ON, `gatewayd` reads the sidecar at **cold spawn only** and applies the surviving keys, filtered twice:

1. `hashing.non_secret_env` drops `ENV_SCRUB_PREFIXES` (`AWS_SECRET*`, `AWS_SESSION*`, `OAUTH*`). These are excluded from `effective_env_hash` **by design** so a credential rotation does not split the pool — which makes the hash non-injective over them, so two sessions with *different* secret values share one backend and no single value is correct to apply.
2. `manager.is_credential_env_key` drops every `_SENSITIVE_ENV_PREFIXES` match (the broader list above, adding `AWS_ACCESS*`, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, `GNUPGHOME`, `GIT_ASKPASS`), so forwarding can never re-introduce a credential key that `_scrub_sensitive_env` deliberately removed from the daemon environment.

The forwarded set is therefore a **strict subset** of the hashed set. Forwarding additionally **verifies coherence at spawn time**: `gatewayd` recomputes `hashing.hash_effective_env` over the sidecar it just read and forwards only when it equals the backend's `PoolKey.effective_env_hash`, skipping forwarding entirely on mismatch. That check is what makes "every forwarded key is part of the PoolKey, so all co-tenants of that backend declared the same value" true rather than merely intended — the stub hashes the sidecar when its session starts, but `gatewayd` re-reads it at cold spawn, so an operator editing `mcpServers.<name>.env` mid-session (with a running stub still holding the old PoolKey, e.g. across an adopted-daemon restart) would otherwise let a crash/idle-reap respawn apply the NEW values under the OLD key. Secret-bearing servers are unaffected: they read credentials from disk (the platform credential helper / the provider's default credential chain, protected per-session by the sandbox bind-mounts) or stay `poolable: false`. The flag fails **closed** — an unreadable config, missing sidecar, malformed sidecar, or hash mismatch all forward nothing.

**Conditional PYTHONPATH/PYTHONHOME strip** — `PYTHONPATH` and `PYTHONHOME` (`_PYTHON_ENV_PREFIXES`) are stripped **only** on the foreign kiro-cli / agent spawn path (`AcpClient._spawn()` → `acp/client.py`, plus `acp/runtime.py`), threaded through the `strip_python_env=True` kwarg passed at exactly those two spawn sites. They are deliberately **excluded** from `_SENSITIVE_ENV_PREFIXES` so KiroCrew's OWN sandboxed Python children (cron scripts, app backends, code-review workers) keep them and can still `import kiro_crew`. Rationale: KiroCrew exports `PYTHONPATH` at its own site-packages, and a foreign MCP server bundling its own interpreter/deps would otherwise prepend KiroCrew's site-packages to `sys.path` and load KiroCrew's fastmcp/cryptography instead of its own — an ABI collision / init hang. This mirrors the PYTHONPATH/PYTHONHOME pop `mcp_gateway/gatewayd.py` already does for the gateway's own children.

**Scoped user-bus locator forward (`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` / `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`)** — the cgroup v2 ceiling wraps every agent-influenced spawn in `systemd-run --user --scope` (`cgroup_scope_argv`, see `resource-protection.md`), and `systemd-run --user` needs the user session bus to create the scope. Callers that build the spawn environment from a strict **allowlist** instead of inheriting `os.environ` — `dashboard/handlers/source_providers.py` (`_PROVIDER_BASE_ENV_KEYS`, the authenticated `gh`/`glab` spawns) is the live example — do not carry the two locators, so `systemd-run` exits 1 with `Failed to connect to bus: No medium found` and the wrapped command never execs. `sandboxed_spawn_argv` therefore calls `cgroup_scope_bus_env()` after `scrub_env`, gated on the same `_probe_cgroup_scope()` result that decides whether to wrap at all.

A user-bus address inside the sandbox is an escape vector — it can ask the user systemd manager to start a unit that runs *outside* the namespace — so the forward is **paired with an `env -u XDG_RUNTIME_DIR -u DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` shim placed inside the scope** (immediately after `--`), which drops the locators again before the real command execs. `env` `exec`s in place, so `--scope`'s exec-into semantics, PID tracking, `killpg` and descendant scans are unchanged; it is resolved from an absolute path (`_ENV_BINARY_CANDIDATES`, never a caller-influenced `PATH`); and with no `env` binary the layer **fails closed** — the locators are not forwarded at all, so the wrapper fails loudly rather than handing the child a reachable bus.

The strip is deliberately **scoped to the keys this layer injected**, not applied unconditionally — mirroring why `_PYTHON_ENV_PREFIXES` above is conditional rather than part of `_SENSITIVE_ENV_PREFIXES`. `scrub_env` does not (and never did) strip the bus locators, so callers that inherit `os.environ` — including the kiro-cli agent spawn — already pass them through: sandboxed agent shells legitimately run `systemctl --user` and the `kirocrew pod` CLI, which are bus-dependent. Unconditional stripping would silently remove that capability across every spawn site. **Documented residual:** an inherited-environment child therefore still reaches the user bus, exactly as before this layer existed. Closing that is a separate, wider change; this layer's invariant is only that it never *widens* bus reachability — a caller that had no bus keeps none.

**Fail-closed default when no backend**: when no sandbox backend is available (e.g. macOS >= 26, or Linux without user namespaces), `wrap_argv()` **raises `RuntimeError`** by default rather than executing the agent unsandboxed — the secure default is to refuse, not degrade. The denial also emits a `denied` SEL tool-invocation event. Running unsandboxed is a deliberate opt-in via `agent.sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec=true`.

**The default is platform-independent, and the wizard is how the opt-in is discovered.** The fallback is `False` on every platform — deriving it from `sys.platform` would hand every backend-less host (every Windows host) an unconfined spawn that no operator declared, which is exactly the deny-by-default authorization the `mode="strict"` callers depend on (an agent-selected repo's `include.path` reaching `~/.aws/credentials`, a crafted `.tex` typesetting a secret into a PDF). What was wrong was only *discoverability*: the refusal was reachable but the remedy was not. So `kirocrew setup` runs `_setup_sandbox_consent()`, which asks `detect_backend()` — platform knowledge stays with the probe, not the config layer — and on `"none"` states what becomes unconfined (`~/.aws`, `~/.ssh`) and prompts, defaulting to **no**. It writes the key only on an explicit yes; declining, a bare Enter, and a non-interactive EOF all leave the config untouched, so the effective default stays fail-closed. It never re-asks once the key is present in either state.

**Nested-sandbox passthrough**: when `wrap_argv()` is called from a process that is *already inside* a KiroCrew sandbox (script-cron ticks, sandboxed agent children, app backends, pooled MCP servers), it returns the argv unchanged (one-shot info log) instead of trying to wrap again. Nested sandboxing is impossible on **both** backends — the Linux launcher's seccomp-BPF filter denies `unshare`/`setns`, and macOS Seatbelt refuses `sandbox_apply` with EPERM from inside an existing sandbox even under an `(allow default)` outer profile — so a nested wrap would fail with EPERM and the fail-closed `RuntimeError` above would brick **every** in-sandbox MCP spawn (the probe error was raised on each `ctx.call_tool` and silently swallowed by the caller). This is **not** a fail-open path: the outer namespace + seccomp still confine every descendant, so passthrough spawns within the existing isolation boundary. In-sandbox detection is env-marker based and **deny-by-default** (`_inside_kirocrew_sandbox()` / `_IN_SANDBOX_MARKER`): the gate keys **solely** on the explicit, single-purpose `KIROCREW_SANDBOX_ACTIVE=1`, which is exported at exactly two sites, each immediately after that platform's credential-env scrub: the Linux launcher `main()` (at the same site as `KIROCREW_HOST_PID`) and the macOS `env` prefix built by `sandbox_exec_argv()`. It deliberately does **not** key on `KIROCREW_HOST_PID` — that variable is dual-purpose session-identity plumbing, and gating a security-relevant passthrough on a variable set for unrelated reasons would be a latent bypass. No unsandboxed code path sets the marker. The passthrough is SEL-audited on **every** invocation via `log_tool_invocation(outcome="allowed", metadata={"reason": "nested_sandbox_passthrough"}, critical=True)`, mirroring the `denied` event on the fail-closed path so the security decision is tamper-evidently recorded. `critical=True` gives it the same write reliability as the `denied`/`delegated` audits — the event is written **synchronously** after draining the async backlog, so a slow or wedged background writer cannot silently drop passthrough records. It stops short of full audit-or-deny (re-raise on SEL failure) deliberately: unlike `_delegate_to_kiro_internal_sandbox` — which on audit failure falls back to KiroCrew's own seatbelt, an equally-safe audited layer — a nested passthrough has **no** safe alternative (seccomp denies the re-wrap by design), so failing the spawn on a SEL filesystem error would couple every in-sandbox MCP call to SEL health and reintroduce a prior in-sandbox spawn outage. On a hard write failure it therefore logs loudly and proceeds: the child is confined by the outer namespace + seccomp whether or not the record lands.

**macOS marker site and the kernel cross-check**: the macOS seatbelt path previously set **no** marker — it is exported only by the Linux namespace launcher — so the passthrough above did not apply on macOS at all. `_probe_sandbox_exec()` therefore failed whenever KiroCrew was already confined, `detect_backend()` cached that EPERM as `"none"`, and the fail-closed branch rejected **every** spawn with "No OS-level sandbox backend is available on this host" — false on a host whose `sandbox-exec` works unnested, and severe in practice (~40 `MCP probe failed` entries at gateway boot, app backends unable to start, Dev Fleet / Files `git` failing). `sandbox_exec_argv()` now sets `KIROCREW_SANDBOX_ACTIVE=1` in the same `env` prefix that already performs the credential-env scrub, as an assignment placed **after** the `-u` flags so they cannot drop it. Because `_sandbox_env_unset_args()` derives that scrub from the **same** `_SENSITIVE_ENV_PREFIXES` / `_AGENT_DENIED_ENV_KEYS` / `_PYTHON_ENV_PREFIXES` logic as the Linux launcher, a marked process always has an environment KiroCrew already sanitised — which is what makes the passthrough safe for the callers that use `wrap_argv()` directly rather than `sandboxed_spawn_argv()`.

On macOS the marker must additionally **agree with the kernel**, and the two cover each other's blind spot. The marker proves KiroCrew built the outer sandbox and scrubbed the environment on the way in, but an env var alone could be forged or inherited. `_macos_sandbox_state()` asks the kernel directly via `sandbox_check(pid, NULL, SANDBOX_FILTER_NONE)`, which is OS-authoritative and unspoofable but cannot identify *whose* profile is active, so it can never grant the passthrough on its own. It is deliberately **tri-state** rather than boolean: a definite `False` (kernel says not sandboxed) alongside a present marker proves the marker was forged into an unconfined process and **vetoes** the passthrough with a `SECURITY:` warning, whereas `None` (symbol unavailable, ABI change, restricted dyld, or non-darwin) says nothing at all and must **not** retroactively invalidate a marker the Linux path honours unconditionally. The state is `lru_cache`d — a process cannot leave its sandbox.

**Foreign outer sandboxes are still refused.** Reaching the fail-closed branch while the kernel reports this process *is* sandboxed means the confiner is one KiroCrew did **not** build — kiro-cli >= 2.13's own internal seatbelt (see the mutual-exclusion rule above) or an operator-wrapped gateway. Those are refused, because macOS exposes no supported way to identify which profile is active (the path-scoped `sandbox_check` form that could prove the outer profile denies credential reads is variadic and returns `-1` through ctypes on arm64), and the env scrub that makes the marker case safe may never have run. What the detection fixes there is the **diagnosis**: `_inside_macos_sandbox()` lets the error state that the host's sandbox is not broken and point at the config-level remedy — disabling kiro-cli's internal sandbox so KiroCrew's own profile owns isolation, which **keeps** isolation rather than weakening it — instead of the previous claim that the host has no backend, which sent operators hunting for something that was never missing. It deliberately does not steer them to `sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec`, which permits unwrapped spawns even when no sandbox confines the process at all.

**No-isolation fallback is loud (SEC-009)**: *on the opted-in path only* (`sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec=true`), `wrap_argv()` runs the agent with no isolation (graceful — the host is not bricked) but never degrades silently: it emits a one-shot loud `SECURITY` warning. A second, distinct flag `agent.sandbox_allow_no_isolation=true` (config-modal editable) acknowledges the risk and demotes that message to info level — it governs *log level only*, not whether execution is permitted (that gate is `allow_unsandboxed_exec`).

**macOS sandbox mutual exclusion**: kiro-cli ≥ 2.13 ships an *internal* agent sandbox in the binary itself, toggled by the `"sandbox"` key in `~/.kiro/settings/amazon-internal.json` (the kiro-cli backend's own settings dir — distinct from KiroCrew's data home `~/.kiro/crew`; the filename is the literal kiro-cli ships). Its in-process seatbelt init cannot nest inside KiroCrew's sandbox-exec wrap: the macOS kernel returns EPERM even under an `(allow default)` outer profile, so **exactly one sandbox layer can be active per kiro-cli spawn**. `wrap_argv()` enforces mutual exclusion on macOS: when `kiro_internal_sandbox_enabled()` is true and the spawn is kiro-cli (argv basename, same convention as `_resolve_kiro_bin`), the seatbelt wrap is skipped and kiro's internal sandbox owns isolation (`_delegate_to_kiro_internal_sandbox()`); when it is false, KiroCrew's seatbelt engages as always. Invariants: (1) this is **not** the forbidden silent unsandboxed fallback (SEC-009) — delegation is config-driven and deterministic, never a reaction to a wrap failure; the child still runs under an OS sandbox; the decision is logged loudly once per process and every delegated spawn emits a SEL audit event (`outcome="delegated"`, `critical=True`) on an **audit-or-deny** basis: if the audit event cannot be written, the delegation is refused and the spawn falls back to KiroCrew's own seatbelt (safety over availability while SEL is broken); (2) the env scrub (`_sandbox_env_unset_args`, shared with `sandbox_exec_argv`) is applied identically on the delegated path; (3) only kiro-cli spawns may delegate — all other agent-influenced spawns keep KiroCrew's wrap regardless of the settings file; (4) the settings read routes through `hooks.safe_read_file` (`is_sensitive_path` on the resolved target + `O_NOFOLLOW` — a symlinked settings file pointing at a sensitive path is refused) and fails toward `False` on any failure (absent/malformed/non-dict JSON, refused read, home-resolution failure → KiroCrew's sandbox stays on); it is uncached so a settings flip applies to the next spawn; (5) macOS-only — Linux namespace isolation is unaffected.

**Boot must isolate the fail-closed raise**: because the `RuntimeError` above can fire per-spawn, callers that launch multiple child processes at boot must catch it. `apps/backend.py:start_enabled_app_backends()` wraps each `start_app_backend()` in try/except so one app that cannot be sandboxed (e.g. on macOS 26 where `sandbox-exec` is gone) is logged + `error`-audited + **skipped** (never spawned unsandboxed), and the gateway (Slack + dashboard + every session) still boots — matching the fail-isolated posture of the admission re-vet and MCP reconcile branches in the same loop.

**Why standard is safe**: The hook layer (`is_sensitive_path()`) still blocks direct file reads of `~/.aws/*` and `~/.ssh/*`. Denied commands block `cat`/`head`/`tail`/`python open()` on those paths. `redact_credentials()` catches any credential patterns that leak through tool output. Three independent layers must all be bypassed simultaneously.

Config: `agent.sandbox` in `config.json` — `"auto"` (standard), `"strict"`, or `"off"`.

**Callers must pass the configured tier explicitly.** `wrap_argv`'s `mode` parameter defaults to `"auto"`, which coincides with the shipped `agent.sandbox` default but is **not** the same thing: it ignores what the operator actually configured. Where `agent.sandbox` is an explicit `"off"` (isolation deferred to kiro-cli's internal sandbox), a spawn that omits `mode` requests isolation the operator did not ask for, and on a host with no backend (any Windows host, macOS >= 26) it fail-closes where the same binary spawned by the chat path succeeds. Passing the configured value is what keeps a one-shot read from being *stricter* than the long-lived chat session it accompanies; it can never make it looser, since both read the same key. The interactive ACP spawns thread the value through their `sandbox_mode` constructor argument; one-shot `kiro-cli` reads call `sandbox.configured_sandbox_mode()` (owning module: `sandbox.py`) instead of relying on the default. This is deliberately **not** a change to `wrap_argv`'s own default, which must stay fail-secure for callers that genuinely want a tier independent of config — the prerequisite probes' `strict`, the credential-free registry clones. See `modules/acp-client.md` for the affected sites and the user-visible symptoms.

Wired into `AcpClient._spawn()` — all kiro-cli processes are sandboxed. Parent KiroCrew process is unaffected. Zero new dependencies (stdlib + system binaries only).

**Linux namespace sandbox**: Fork child → child calls `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)` → parent writes identity UID/GID map (`uid uid 1` / `gid gid 1`) to `/proc/<child>/{setgroups,uid_map,gid_map}` → child calls `unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)`, sets mount propagation private (`MS_REC|MS_PRIVATE`), bind-mounts empty dirs over credential paths (per mode), scrubs sensitive env vars (`AWS_SECRET*`, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, etc.), and execs the agent. Two-pipe synchronization ensures correct ordering. The child retains the real UID/GID so all toolchains (JVM ByteBuddy, Gradle, npm, etc.) work without workarounds. Implemented as a Python launcher script (`_build_launcher_script()`) spawned by `namespace_argv()`.

**Linux capability probe mirrors the split sequence**: `_probe_unshare_once()` performs the *same* fork → `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)` → parent-writes-maps → `unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)` handshake as the launcher above, because the two flags do **not** behave identically when combined. A single `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER | CLONE_NEWNS)` is satisfied atomically and **succeeds** on hosts where the split sequence fails: with Ubuntu's `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1` (default since 23.10, and the discriminator is that **sysctl being 1**, not whether AppArmor is loaded — Debian 13 ships AppArmor and is unaffected), creating a user namespace transitions the process into a restricted AppArmor profile carrying no `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, so the *second* unshare returns EPERM while the identity map writes succeed. The probe therefore previously reported such hosts as `namespace`-capable and every real spawn died with `sandbox: unshare(NEWNS) failed: errno 1` — verified on Ubuntu 24.04 and 26.04. The probe's `reason` names the failing step (`unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)` / a `/proc/<pid>/...` map write / `unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)`) so callers can distinguish mechanisms that share an errno: a NEWNS denial is the AppArmor userns restriction, whereas NEWUSER with ENOSPC/EUSERS is a hardened `user.max_user_namespaces=0`. Classification is unchanged — EPERM stays **permanent** (an AppArmor denial will not clear on retry) and only `_TRANSIENT_PROBE_ERRNOS` are transient; a child that vanishes mid-handshake is treated as transient without widening that set. All verdict logic runs in the parent, driven by the child's pipe reports, so tests cover every branch without forking; the handshake is bounded by a timeout and the child is reaped on every path so the background warm thread can neither wedge nor leak.

**Ubuntu userns remedy — a per-application AppArmor profile installed by `kirocrew service install`** (`service/apparmor.py`): the probe above makes the restriction *visible*; this makes it *fixable* without weakening the host. Ubuntu's sanctioned mechanism for an application that legitimately needs unprivileged userns is a per-app profile granting `userns`, not a kernel-wide sysctl rollback — `/etc/apparmor.d/` on a stock install already ships exactly this for `bwrap-userns-restrict`, `chrome`, `chromium`, `brave`, `buildah`, `ch-run`, `QtWebEngineProcess`, `1password` and `Discord`.

- **Gated on the detected mechanism, never on distro ID.** All of: AppArmor present in `/sys/kernel/security/lsm`, `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns` **existing and equal to 1**, and `apparmor_parser` ≥ 4.x (the `userns` rule's minimum). Any miss skips silently and the install continues, so Debian, Arch, RHEL, Amazon Linux and macOS are unaffected no-ops. Keying on `/etc/os-release` would both miss Ubuntu derivatives (Pop!_OS, Mint, Zorin, elementary) that inherit the restriction and wrongly target Debian 13, which ships AppArmor *without* it.
- **A NAMED profile with no attachment path, applied by systemd** via `AppArmorProfile=-kirocrew-userns` in the unit. The obvious alternative — attaching the profile to the gateway's interpreter — is wrong in both directions: `~/.kiro/crew-venv/bin/python3` is a **symlink** to the system interpreter and AppArmor matches the path the kernel resolves, so a venv-path attachment silently never matches, while attaching to the resolved `/usr/bin/python3` would grant unprivileged userns to **every Python process on the host**. A named profile confines exactly one systemd unit and is independent of interpreter resolution. The `-` prefix makes the directive best-effort: a missing or unloaded profile must never stop the gateway from starting, because that would turn a hardening step into an outage — without the profile the sandbox simply cannot be built and spawns fail closed, which is the pre-existing behaviour.
- **`flags=(unconfined)` and a single `userns,` rule** — the profile restricts nothing else; it exists only to carry that one grant, the same shape `/etc/apparmor.d/chrome` uses.
- **The abi is detected from the policy files present** (`/etc/apparmor.d/abi/`, highest numeric wins, omitted when none exist), not from the parser version: Ubuntu 25.10 ships `apparmor_parser` 5.x but only `abi/3.0` and `abi/4.0` on disk, so pinning the abi to the parser major makes the profile fail to load with `Could not open 'abi/5.0'`.
- **Validate before loading, verify enforcement after.** The generated profile is parsed with `apparmor_parser -Q --skip-cache` (`--skip-cache` because writing `/var/cache/apparmor` needs root and this runs before any privileged step) and is NOT installed if it fails to compile — loading a broken profile is how a service becomes unstartable. After `apparmor_parser -r`, enforcement is confirmed by transitioning into the profile with `aa-exec -p` and running a namespace probe, because the installing process is not itself confined by a profile systemd applies to the service, so probing in-process would report the unpatched host. Three constraints shape that check. It needs **privilege to enter** the profile — `aa_change_onexec()` into a named profile is not permitted for an unconfined user and `aa-exec` does not fail loudly when it cannot transition, it execs unconfined, so an unprivileged attempt returns a false negative. It must **not execute anything user-writable as root**: every tool (`apparmor_parser`, `aa-exec`, `setpriv`, `python3`) is resolved from a fixed list of trusted system directories and required to be root-owned and not group/world-writable — never through `$PATH`, and never `sys.executable`, since the venv interpreter is user-writable and running it under `sudo` would be a local privilege escalation — and the payload is a constant stdlib snippet that does not import `kiro_crew`, so user-writable site-packages never runs with privilege. And the probe itself must run **unprivileged**, or it proves nothing: root may be permitted to create namespaces regardless of the restriction, so `setpriv` drops back to the invoking uid/gid inside the profile before probing. A missing trusted tool is reported as inconclusive rather than as a failure, and a profile that loads but does not take effect is worse than none, so an unconfirmed verification says exactly that instead of claiming success.
- **The profile is loaded BEFORE the unit is started.** `AppArmorProfile=` is applied by systemd at service start, so installing it after `systemctl restart` would leave the first gateway process unprofiled and every agent spawn failing closed until the next restart. `linux.install()` therefore writes the unit, loads the profile, and only then runs `daemon-reload`/`enable`/`restart`.
- **Fail-soft throughout, and symmetric on removal.** No step here can fail the service install; every path returns an outcome the CLI prints (`⚠️` on failure) and continues. `service uninstall` unloads (`apparmor_parser -R`) and deletes the profile, so a host is left as it was found rather than carrying an orphaned grant. Privilege reuses the existing `sudo install` / `sudo systemctl` path the unit write already needs — no new escalation, and no KiroCrew or LLM-influenced code runs under sudo.
- **Verified end to end on Ubuntu 26.04** with the sysctl at 1: inside the profile `detect_backend()` returns `namespace`; outside it, on the same host at the same moment, `none` with `unshare(CLONE_NEWNS) failed with errno 1 (EPERM)`; and `apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns` remains `1` — the grant is app-scoped and the kernel-wide protection is untouched.
- Other ways unprivileged userns can be denied are **not** addressed by this profile and have different remedies (and different errnos): `user.max_user_namespaces=0` denies NEWUSER with ENOSPC/EUSERS; Debian's legacy `kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0`; a kernel without `CONFIG_USER_NS` (EINVAL/ENOSYS); and a container whose seccomp filter denies `unshare`, which is fixed with container flags, not host config. The probe's step-aware reason is what makes these distinguishable at diagnosis time.
- **A DIRECT launch (AppImage / desktop app) needs a second, ATTACHED profile** — `/etc/apparmor.d/kirocrew-launcher`, installed by `kirocrew sandbox install-profile`. The named profile above is applied *by systemd*, so it covers the installed unit and nothing else; a double-clicked AppImage has no unit, Electron execs the bundled backend itself, and both run unconfined. The launcher cannot transition itself either: entering a named profile needs `aa_change_onexec`, which an unprivileged unconfined process is not permitted to do, and `aa-exec` does not fail loudly when it cannot transition — it execs unconfined, so a re-exec would appear to work while changing nothing (`sudo aa-exec` does transition, but would run the gateway as root). An **attachment** is applied by the kernel at exec time with no cooperation from the process, and is inherited by the backend; it is the mechanism stock Ubuntu already uses for `chrome`, `brave`, `1password` and `Discord`. This does **not** contradict the named-profile decision above: that decision rejected attaching to the gateway's *interpreter*, which is a symlink to a shared system binary. An AppImage is a single self-contained file used by nothing else, which is what makes it a safe attachment target.
- **The attachment target is validated, because an attachment is a permission grant keyed on a path.** `validate_exec_path()` resolves the path first (AppArmor matches what the kernel resolves, so validating the pre-resolution path would let a symlink in a safe directory smuggle a grant onto `/bin/sh`) and then refuses: a **world-writable component anywhere in the chain up to `/`** (a writable *ancestor* is enough — rename the parent and the same absolute path resolves to an attacker's file; this also covers an AppImage's own `/tmp/.mount_XXXXXX`, a fresh random path per launch), a **shared interpreter** (`/usr/bin/python3`, `/bin/sh`, `node`, …), a path containing **glob metacharacters**, which AppArmor interprets inside an attachment even when quoted, and **any target not owned by the invoking user**. That last rule is what makes the check sound: the interpreter regex is a blocklist, and a blocklist of shared runtimes is incomplete by construction — it names python, perl, ruby, node and the shells but not `java`, `mono`, `dotnet`, `php`, `lua`, `wine`, `R` or `qemu-*`, so `--path /usr/bin/java` would have granted unprivileged userns to every Java process on the host. Requiring caller ownership converts that leaky list into a complete invariant, since a root-owned executable in a system location is by definition shared with every user of the machine. Stock Ubuntu's `chrome`/`brave` profiles do attach to root-owned binaries, which is not a contradiction: a packager knows the path is one specific application, whereas this command is handed an arbitrary `--path` and cannot. Packaged profiles remain the answer for a system-wide install, and an administrator who deliberately runs as root can still attach to a root-owned path — the rule exists to stop an unprivileged user over-granting by accident. The default target is `$APPIMAGE`; a foreground `kirocrew gateway` has no safe target at all and is directed to `service install` instead. Both profiles share one gate, one parser resolution, one compile check and one enforcement probe (`verify_enforcement(..., profile_name=…)`), so they cannot drift apart in what counts as a supported host or a working grant.
- **A path attachment fails silently when the path changes**, which is the one failure mode the kernel reports no error for: a moved or renamed AppImage simply stops matching. `kirocrew sandbox status` compares the installed attachment against the current launch and reports a stale one as not covered, and the desktop app logs the exact remedy command at spawn time (`website/electron/sandbox-profile.js`) rather than attempting to escalate — `sudo` needs a TTY a GUI does not have. Install also warns when another profile in `/etc/apparmor.d` already attaches to the same path, since a hand-written profile is the workaround users find first and two profiles claiming one attachment is ambiguous.

**Edition-neutral executable resolution**: `namespace_argv()` (Linux) and
`sandbox_exec_argv()` (macOS) resolve argv[0] through
`PlatformContext.agent_executable` before applying KiroCrew's outer sandbox.
The public `DefaultAgentExecutableResolver` is identity, so ordinary PATH
resolution and an explicit `KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN` override behave unchanged. An
edition companion may replace a managed launcher with the direct executable it
ultimately invokes when nesting two OS-isolation layers would fail. This seam
cannot disable sandboxing: the resolved executable is always placed *inside*
the same namespace/Seatbelt wrapper. A transient resolver failure falls back to
the original executable while preserving the outer sandbox; a platform
composition failure propagates fail-closed. The capability probe
(`_probe_sandbox_exec`) still runs only the trusted fixed `/usr/bin/true` target
under `(allow default)`, never an edition-resolved or user-writable executable.

### XPIA Hardening (`security.py` + `hooks.py`)

**Sensitive path protection** — blocks at the hook layer before tool execution:
- `is_sensitive_path(path)` — checks `fs_read`/`ReadFile` targets against sensitive dirs
- `path_contains_sensitive(dir)` — the **reverse direction**: True when a protected location lies UNDER the given directory (the home dir itself, or any ancestor of `~/.ssh`/`~/.aws`/the crew data home). For bulk operations rooted at a directory — e.g. the Notes builtin's `git add -A` over an attached vault (see [md-notebook.md](md-notebook.md)) — where `is_sensitive_path` on the root passes but the sweep would stage a credential store wholesale. List-based prefix comparison against the known sensitive roots (no filesystem walk, O(sensitive entries) on any tree size); shares `_candidate_forms` / `_home_dir_targets` with `is_sensitive_path` so the symlink/casefold/`KIROCREW_HOME` hardening cannot drift between the two directions
- **Symlink resolution (CWE-59)**: `is_sensitive_path()` resolves symlinks before matching — it checks multiple candidate forms (`os.path.realpath` + `Path.resolve`, plus the lexically-normalized path as a fail-safe when resolution can't complete) and returns True if ANY lands in a sensitive location, `casefold`-comparing against sensitive dirs anchored at BOTH the logical home and its realpath (defeats a home-prefix OS symlink like macOS `/var`→`/private/var`). So a workspace symlink pointing at `~/.aws/credentials` (absolute or `../../.aws/credentials` traversal) cannot be read through the link
- **Relative-traversal block (verb-agnostic)**: home-anchored/absolute references to a sensitive dir are caught by the primary matcher (`_get_sensitive_re()`), but relative-traversal forms (`../../.aws/credentials`) escape it. `is_sensitive_bash_command()` therefore blocks **any** command whose tokens name a sensitive dir via dot-slash traversal (`_RELATIVE_SENSITIVE_RE`), regardless of verb — so `dd`/`base64`/`xxd`/`head`/`tail`/`cp`/`ln` are all covered (it was previously gated on `ln`/`cp` only, letting the others slip past). Returns "command references a sensitive credential path via relative traversal"
- `is_sensitive_bash_command(cmd)` — regex matches `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less`, `cp`, `scp`, `python open()`, pipe redirects targeting sensitive paths
- `hooks.on_tool_call` runs **both** `is_sensitive_path` and `is_sensitive_bash_command` on the **normalized** tool title regardless of the kiro-cli `Reading: `/`Running: ` display prefix. The claude-agent-acp adapter sets a file-read tool's title to the bare path and a Bash tool's title to the bare command (no prefix), so gating either check on the prefix would let credential reads through on an alternate ACP backend. `is_sensitive_path` resolves the title as a path (a bare `~/.aws/credentials` matches; a `cat ~/.aws/credentials` command resolves to a non-sensitive path and is caught by `is_sensitive_bash_command` instead).
- Sensitive paths: `~/.aws`, `~/.ssh`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.gpg`, `~/.config/gcloud`, `~/.azure`, `~/.docker/config.json`, `~/.kube/config`, `~/.npmrc`, `~/.pypirc`, `~/.netrc`, `~/.git-credentials`, `~/.kiro/crew/.env`, `~/.kiro/crew/sel_hmac.key`, `~/.kiro/crew/security_events.jsonl`, `~/.kiro/crew/app_admission.json`, `~/.kiro/crew/run`
- **Crew data-home secret/trust-root leaves are covered under EVERY known home prefix.** Since the data home moved from top-level `~/.kirocrew` to `~/.kiro/crew`, each Kiro Crew secret / governance trust-root leaf (`.env`, `browser-cookies.txt`, `playwright-storage-state.json`, `sel_hmac.key`, `security_events.jsonl`, `app_admission.json`, `security_policy.json`, `profiles`, `admission_policy.json`, `denied_commands.json`, `live_target.json`, `node-bin-dir`, `token_signing.key`, `refresh_chains.json`, `.local_secret`, `run`) is expanded onto `_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS` under each entry of `_CREW_HOME_PREFIXES = (".kiro/crew", ".kirocrew")`. So the same leaf is read+write-blocked in (1) the current home `~/.kiro/crew` and (2) a not-yet-migrated pre-move legacy home `~/.kirocrew`. The migration force-deletes `~/.kirocrew` once the move completes — there is no rollback copy to gate. A new secret is added to `_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES` once and is covered in both locations.
- **SEL audit trust root (Talos finding cdf82704)** — `~/.kiro/crew/sel_hmac.key` (the HMAC-SHA256 signing key for the tamper-evident audit chain) and `~/.kiro/crew/security_events.jsonl` (the audit log itself) are on the sensitive floor. Without this an audited agent could `fs_read` the key and forge/rewrite the chain, or rewrite the log directly, erasing evidence of its own actions. The gateway's own SEL writer/reader (`sel.py`, `dashboard/session_health.py`) opens these files directly and does **not** route through `is_sensitive_path()`, so audit logging is unaffected. Residual: the key still lives in the agent's namespace; a deeper out-of-process signer (key never exposed to the agent) is documented future hardening.
- **App admission trust root (keystone invariant)** — `~/.kiro/crew/app_admission.json` (the sole fleet-controlled App Kit admission ceiling loaded by `apps/admission.py`) is on the sensitive floor, read- and write-blocked through the shared file gate. Because an **absent** policy falls open (admit), a governed agent that could `fs_write`/`tee`/`rm` this file could delete or neuter its own admission ceiling and re-admit a banned/unsigned app. Adding it to `_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS` also arms the bash write/extract matcher (`tee`/`rm`/redirect). The gateway's own loader (`apps.admission.load_app_admission_policy`) opens it directly via `path.read_text()` and does **not** route through `is_sensitive_path()`, so legitimate policy loading is unaffected.
- **Runtime exec dir trust root (run-marker sandbox-escape)** — the `run/` dir under the crew home is on the sensitive floor (under every `_CREW_HOME_PREFIXES` entry) because the gateway executes its contents **outside** the agent sandbox: the sandbox launcher scripts (`sandbox.py` execs `python <home>/run/kirocrew_sandbox_*.py`) and the remote-instance run-marker `gateway-<port>.bin` (`instances/run_marker.py`), whose recorded launcher path the SSH token-mint **and** the `restart_remote` action read and `exec` on the remote host. Without this floor entry a prompt-injected / sandboxed agent that could `fs_write` (or `tee`/redirect) a marker — or a launcher — into `run/` could point it at an attacker-controlled binary that the next routine token refresh or restart execs unsandboxed (owner + `-x` checks don't help; agent writes run as the same user) — a reachable sandbox escape. Classifying the whole dir also arms the bash write/extract matcher. The gateway's own writers (`instances/run_marker.write_marker` via `atomic_write`, and the sandbox launcher writer) open these paths directly and do **not** route through `is_sensitive_path()`, so gateway startup/spawn is unaffected.
- **Live-target pointer (keystone leaf `live_target.json`)** — `~/.kiro/crew/live_target.json` decides which checkout the gateway `execve`s into at startup (Dev Fleet "Make live"), so a writable pointer is arbitrary code execution under the gateway's own identity, and a readable one tells an attacker which checkout to aim at. Added to `_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`, so it is read+write-blocked under every `_CREW_HOME_PREFIXES` entry through the shared file gate. Only the human-driven dashboard cutover action (`_make_live` in `dev_fleet/server.py`) writes it, via `live_target.write_target()`. The gateway's own startup reader (`live_target.maybe_reexec` called from `cli.py`) opens it directly rather than through the gate, so live-target resolution is unaffected.

- **Computer-use primary enable (keystone leaf `computer_use.json`)** — the on/off switch for native desktop GUI automation (see [computer-use.md](computer-use.md)) is `~/.kiro/crew/computer_use.json`, added to `_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES` so it is read+write-blocked under every `_CREW_HOME_PREFIXES` entry, on both the tool path (`is_sensitive_path`) and every shell form (`is_sensitive_bash_command` — `cat`, `>`, `tee`, `rm`, plus `tar -C` / `unzip -d` extraction into the trust root via `_EXTRACT_INTO_TRUST_ROOT_RE`). **It is deliberately NOT in `config.json`**, and the precedent is the denied-command opt-out immediately below: `is_sensitive_write_path("~/.kiro/crew/config.json")` is `True`, but `is_sensitive_bash_command("echo x > ~/.kiro/crew/config.json")` is `None` and `is_denied(...)` is `None` (at the time that precedent was set `_WRITE_PROTECTED_BASH_LEAVES` was `('.data-home-ready',)` only; it now also carries the two Ops Mission Control authorization inputs described below, and `config.json` is still deliberately absent from it), so a `config.json` toggle would be flippable by a prompt-injected agent through any redirect. A primary enable for full desktop observation plus input synthesis is a **security ceiling**, the same class as the deny opt-out, so it lives on the keystone. Reads fail soft to `{}` → **disabled**, and `is_enabled()` is a strict identity test against `True` (a hand-edited `"enabled": "false"` or `1` does not enable desktop control). The only writer is the dashboard PUT handler, which does not route through the agent tool gate; `enable_state.load_state()` opens the file directly, so legitimate reads are unaffected. The file carries no separate pointer opt-in: an earlier revision documented an `allow_pointer_move` flag (plus a `capabilities.computer_use_pointer` governance row) as a second consent gate for the one click path that warps the operator's REAL mouse pointer (`click_method: "global"`), and both were removed by product decision — `PolicyConfig.from_state` reads only `allowed_apps` / `extra_denied_apps`, so writing the flag has no effect and must not be re-documented without being re-implemented. That path is instead contained by requiring the model to NAME the method (`auto` never resolves onto it) and by a dedicated SEL `tool_kind` on every use.

- **Browser Mode enable/engine gate (keystone leaves `browser-mode-enabled`, `browser-engine`)** — Browser Mode's durable on switch is the file `~/.kiro/crew/browser-mode-enabled`; while it is present the backend registers the Playwright MCP proxy in kiro's `mcp.json`, which mounts the `browser_*` tools into the agent's tool list and thereby authorizes it to operate a real browser (and in attach mode, the operator's own running, logged-in browser); removing the flag deregisters the proxy so the tools disappear. Presence alone is the authorization — there is no per-message marker — so it is the same class of security ceiling as `computer_use.json` above and lives on the read+write keystone floor rather than in the agent-writable `config.json` — otherwise a prompt-injected, auto-approved shell could `touch` it to self-grant browser operation. Both it and the sibling `browser-engine` leaf (which selects the browser Playwright launches) are read+write-blocked on the tool path (`is_sensitive_path`) and every shell form (`touch`, `>`, `tee`, extraction verbs). The dashboard PUT handler is the only writer and opens the paths directly; `browser.setup` reads them via direct `config_dir()` path ops, not through the gate, so the Settings toggle and the launch path are unaffected.

- **Node executable trust root (keystone leaf `node-bin-dir`)** — the saved directory decides which `node`, `npm`, and `npx` Browser Mode later executes in the unsandboxed gateway. A prompt-injected agent that could point it at an agent-writable directory would turn the next setup retry into a sandbox escape. The marker is therefore read+write-blocked under every crew-home prefix, and direct path writes are caught by the existing sensitive-path/bash gates. The trusted setup script and a human operator writing the file outside the agent tool path do not traverse PreToolUse and remain able to update the marker. Browser Mode does not add package-manager-specific fallback directories; Homebrew Node requires an explicit operator marker or process environment. Automatic version-manager layouts are a residual same-UID trust surface shared with the build resolver, so this discovery policy does not claim a complete same-UID security boundary.

**Write-only config protection** (`is_sensitive_write_path` in `security.py` + `hooks.py`) — runtime config files are protected against *modification* by agent tools while staying *readable*:
- `~/.kiro/crew/config.json` and `~/.kiro/crew/config.local.json` are in a write-only tier (`_WRITE_PROTECTED_HOME_PATHS`, expanded under every `_CREW_HOME_PREFIXES` entry so the pre-move legacy copy is covered too), deliberately NOT in the read+write `_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS` list above — the dashboard file viewer, `cat`, and knowledge indexing legitimately read config.
- `is_sensitive_write_path(path)` is a superset of `is_sensitive_path(path)`, sharing the same `_path_in_home_dirs` resolve/casefold core so the two gates can't drift. `hooks.on_tool_call` denies a file-EDIT tool call (ACP `edit` kind) whose `path`/`file_path` resolves to a config file.
- Empty/unknown ACP tool kinds are intentionally left to the load-time clamp backstop rather than hard-denied, to avoid over-blocking config reads that arrive without a kind (governance's shape inference can apply both read+write scopes because it is a permissive policy intersection; this gate is a hard deny). Bash writes (`tee`, `>`, `sed -i`) likewise fall to the clamp.
- The operator edits config out-of-band via the dashboard config API / CLI, which do not route through this gate.

**Data-home completion-marker protection** (`.data-home-ready`) — the marker whose presence makes `~/.kiro/crew` authoritative (migration is skipped once it exists, and a leftover legacy home is treated as debris). Because its mere *presence* is the trust signal — and, unlike config files, **no load-time clamp neutralizes a planted value** — a prompt-injected agent that could create it in a pre-migration home would make the next boot skip migration and ignore the legacy home's governance policy + secrets (deleting it forces a needless re-migration). It is therefore protected on *both* enforcement layers:
- **File-edit tool gate**: the marker is in `_WRITE_PROTECTED_HOME_PATHS` (under every `_CREW_HOME_PREFIXES` entry), so `is_sensitive_write_path` denies an ACP `edit`-kind write to it while reads stay allowed.
- **Bash gate**: the marker leaf is also in `_WRITE_PROTECTED_BASH_LEAVES`, and `is_sensitive_bash_command` matches it **verb-independently** (any command naming the home-anchored marker path, including a trailing-`/` subpath so `mkdir -p …/.data-home-ready/x` — which also materializes it — is caught). This mirrors the verb-independent backstop the sensitive-dir matcher uses, so quoted redirects / `cp` / `python open()` / novel write verbs cannot bypass an enumerated allowlist. Bash *reads* are incidentally blocked too — harmless, since the marker holds no secret (it is deliberately NOT in `_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`, so file-read tools and `is_sensitive_path` are unaffected) and the only legitimate readers (`kirocrew doctor`, the migration code) use Python `os` calls, not bash.
- The migration code stamps the marker directly in Python (not via a tool/bash), so legitimate stamping is unaffected. As with credential paths, the bash gate is home-anchored, defense-in-depth: a `cd`-into-home + bare-relative-leaf write is a pre-existing limitation shared by every sensitive-path rule, not specific to the marker.

**Ops Mission Control authorization inputs** (`apps/ops-mission-control/data/rotation.yaml`,
`apps/ops-mission-control/data/incidents/index.json`) — two app-owned files that are
write-protected on both layers for the same reason as the marker above, and with the same
read/write asymmetry. They are not settings and no load-time clamp neutralizes a forged value:
they are **inputs to an authorization decision**.

- `rotation.yaml` is the committed on-call schedule. An agent that rewrites it to name its own
  login makes `rotation.authorize_action` → `_definitely_off_shift` accept a forged shift and
  execute an off-shift production write against a teammate's incident tooling.
- `incidents/index.json` is the incident store. `/incident/action` reads the incident by id and
  hands `incident.signal` to the same gate, whose act-rules key on `source` / `resource` /
  `labels` — so an agent that rewrites the record can pair a resource an operator's rule
  authorizes with a *different* provider target, and the gate approves one signal while the sink
  mutates another. Resolving the signal server-side (the fix used for the same defect on
  `/incident/claim`) cannot help, because the store IS the server's copy.

Both stay **readable** on the tool path, and that is load-bearing rather than incidental: every
teammate's instance must read the schedule to answer "am I on call?", and the index is the board
the dashboard renders. Neither holds a secret, so neither is in `_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`. Bash
*reads* are incidentally blocked by the verb-independent leaf matcher, which is harmless for the
same reason it is harmless for the marker — the legitimate readers are the app's own Python code.
The gateway's writers (`store.claim` / `update_fields`, and `ledger_sync`'s `git checkout` on the
schedule) open these paths directly and do not route through the tool gate, so the app and team
sync keep working.

**Load-time resource-limit clamp** (`config/loader.py`) — defends against a config-loader bound bypass: the dashboard config API rejects out-of-range writes, but a direct edit of `config.json` (any process as the same OS user, or a prompt-injected agent with file-write access) bypassed that gate.
- `KiroCrewConfig.load()` calls `_clamp_security_bounds(data)` on the disk-read path (before caching) so cache hits and the `GET /api/config/kirocrew` serialization both report clamped values.
- Clamped knobs: `agent.subagent_auto_max` ≤ `SUBAGENT_AUTO_MAX_CEILING` (64), `agent.max_subagents` ≤ 64, `agent.subagent_max_turns` ≤ `SUBAGENT_MAX_TURNS_CEILING` (200), `session.pool_size` ≤ `POOL_SIZE_MAX` (10). Mins match existing runtime floors (0/1); `bool` and non-int values are left untouched for dataclass coercion.
- The ceilings live once in `config.loader` and are imported by the API write-gate (`dashboard/handlers/core.py`) and the runtime pool cap (`session._MAX_POOL`), so the write-gate, runtime cap, and load-time clamp cannot drift.
- A clamp is logged at WARNING and recorded as a `config_bounds_clamped` SEL tamper event (best-effort, never fatal — config loading must not raise). This neutralizes any inflated on-disk value regardless of how it was written.

**URL exfiltration detection** — scans LLM output before posting to Slack/dashboard:
- `scan_exfiltration_urls(text)` — flags the payload not the destination (host-agnostic except one narrow carve-out below)
- Detects: long query strings (≥200 chars), base64 blobs (40+ chars), heavy URL-encoding, AWS access key IDs (`AKIA`/`ASIA`), SSH keys, private key headers, Slack tokens
- Hard credential markers (`_HARD_CREDENTIAL_RE`) are scanned across the **full path AND query**, not just the query after `?`, so a secret embedded in the URL path (`http://host/AKIA…`, no `?`) is caught (Talos 78224f3f). `_URL_RE` matches DNS names, **raw IPv4 literals** (incl. IMDS `169.254.169.254`), and **bracketed IPv6 literals** so a raw-IP exfil destination is not silently skipped. `_URL_RE`'s path/query group starts with `[/?]`, so a query attached **directly to the host with no path segment** (`https://host?leak=<secret>`) is captured and scanned too — previously that group required a leading `/`, so such a URL yielded no path/query group and both scan/redact bailed on `qmark == -1`, skipping the query entirely (exfil bypass). The base64-blob/query-length heuristics stay query-only (long base64 path segments — CDN asset ids, git object hashes — are benign); the S3-presigned exemption is applied before the path scan. Per-URL classification is a single shared helper (`_exfil_url_warning`) used by both scan and redact so the two paths cannot drift. **Exact-host heuristic exemption**: a companion `CredentialPolicy` may supply a set of trusted-tenant hosts (`_exempt_exact_hosts()`; the public Default returns an empty set) that skip **only** the base64-blob and query-length heuristics — the ones that false-positive on legitimate long base64 document pointers (e.g. SharePoint `nav=` links). Hosts are matched **case-insensitively** (both the captured host and the set members are lowercased, per RFC 4343) and **exactly** (not by suffix, so a shared multi-tenant domain does not exempt every tenant). The hard-credential floor (`_HARD_CREDENTIAL_RE`) **and** the heavy percent-encoding detector (`_EXFIL_PERCENT_RE`) stay **unconditional** — an AWS key / SSH-or-PEM header / Slack token / URL-encoded payload on an exempted host is still flagged and redacted.
- `redact_exfiltration_urls(text)` — replaces suspicious URLs with `[REDACTED: suspicious URL to {domain}]`

**Credential output redaction** — catches raw credential patterns in LLM/tool output:
- `redact_credentials(text)` — scans for plaintext AND base64-encoded credentials
- Plaintext patterns: `AKIA`/`ASIA` access key IDs, `SecretAccessKey=`, `aws_secret_access_key=`, `SessionToken=`, `aws_session_token=`, PEM private keys (`-----BEGIN [A-Z ]*PRIVATE KEY-----`), Slack tokens (`xoxb-`/`xoxp-`)
- **Full-block PEM redaction** (`05687e60`): the PEM sub-alternative spans the ENTIRE key block (header + base64 body up to the END marker), not just the header phrase. Because `redact_credentials()` replaces the matched SPAN, a header-only match left the secret base64 body verbatim on every output surface. The body class is `[\s\S]*?` (not base64-only) so encrypted keys — whose `Proc-Type:`/`DEK-Info:` headers carry `:`/`,` — are fully spanned; a truncated block (no END) consumes only subsequent PEM body lines (each must start with a newline), so a `BEGIN` header mentioned inline in prose matches only the header and does not swallow trailing lines to end-of-string. **Round-3:** the trailing `(?=\r?\n[A-Za-z0-9+/=])` lookahead alternative lets the run cross a SINGLE blank line when the next line begins with base64 material — RFC 1421 ENCRYPTED PEMs place a MANDATORY blank line between the `DEK-Info:` header and the base64 body, and without this lookahead the per-line "must contain a base64 char" rule stopped at that blank line and leaked the whole encrypted body (for both a truncated key and a complete encrypted key whose body exceeds the full-block cap). Because the lookahead consumes nothing, TWO+ consecutive blank lines still terminate the run, so trailing prose is preserved (no over-redaction)
- **Third-party provider families**: ~12 distinctive fixed-prefix token formats added beyond AWS/Slack — GitHub (`ghp_`/`gho_`/`ghu_`/`ghs_`/`ghr_` PATs + `github_pat_` fine-grained), GitLab (`glpat-`), Stripe (`sk_live_`/`rk_live_`/`_test_`), SendGrid (`SG.`), OpenAI (`sk-proj-`), Anthropic (`sk-ant-`), npm (`npm_`), PyPI (`pypi-`), DigitalOcean (`dop_v1_`/`doo_`/`dor_`), Google OAuth client secrets (`GOCSPX-`) — plus DB connection URIs with embedded credentials (`postgres`/`mysql`/`mongodb`/`redis`/`amqp` `://user:pass@`). Prefixes are case-sensitive with minimum lengths set slightly below real token lengths (over-redaction on a prefix match is the safe direction)
- **JSON-aware key-value matching**: key-value patterns allow an optional quote (`[\"']?`) between the key name and the separator (`[:=]`), matching both bare `aws_secret_access_key=VALUE` and JSON `"aws_secret_access_key": "VALUE"` formats. The value class uses `[^\s"',}]+` (bounded, stops at JSON structural delimiters) rather than greedy `\S+`, preventing over-capture in compact JSON that would swallow adjacent fields and mask subsequent credentials
- **JWT / JWE / OAuth Bearer tokens** (cc1d6bdd; JWE hardening a8e5fe6a; JSON-aware Bearer): JWTs (`eyJ<header>.<payload>.<sig>` — `eyJ` is the base64url of the `{"` header prefix) and HTTP `Authorization: Bearer <token>` headers. The `eyJ` segment quantifier is `(?:\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]*){2,4}` so it redacts both a 3-segment signed JWT (JWS) and a 5-segment encrypted JWT (JWE, RFC 7516 — `header.encrypted_key.iv.ciphertext.tag`) as one whole token — including `dir`/`ECDH-ES` JWEs whose Encrypted Key segment is EMPTY (`header..iv.ciphertext.tag`); the earlier fixed 3-segment pattern truncated a JWE and leaked its ciphertext + tag. The JWT alternative is case-sensitive (`eyJ` is a fixed base64url prefix); the Bearer header name + scheme are matched case-insensitively via scoped `(?i:…)` groups because HTTP header names are case-insensitive (RFC 7230 §3.2), HTTP/2 mandates lowercase names, and the `Bearer` scheme is case-insensitive (RFC 6750 §2.1) — so lowercase `authorization: bearer …` from `requests`/`net/http`/HTTP2 frame logs is redacted too. The header/scheme separator is JSON-aware: an optional quote may precede the `:`/`=` and the token (`(?i:Authorization)["']?\s*[:=]\s*["']?(?i:Bearer)…`), so a serialized `{"Authorization": "Bearer <tok>"}` in a structured-log/JSON request dump is redacted, not just the raw HTTP header. Both are scoped tightly — the JWT segment class `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` cannot cross the literal `.` separators, and the Bearer token class (`[A-Za-z0-9._~+/-]+=*`, RFC 6750 `b64token`) stops at whitespace/quotes — so neither over-captures. A `Bearer` header carrying a JWT redacts as a single match (the Bearer alternative's class subsumes the JWT), while a bare JWT is caught independently (defense in depth). Bare `eyJ…` with no `.`-segments and the word `Bearer` without the `Authorization:` prefix are NOT redacted (no false positives). **Two-segment dashboard link token**: `dashboard.token_auth.generate_token` emits `base64url(payload).base64url(hmac_sig)`, which is TWO segments, so the `{2,4}` quantifier never matched it and the token fell through to the pass-3 bare-secret heuristic, whose run class `[A-Za-z0-9+/]` is standard base64 and excludes base64url's `-`/`_`. Redaction therefore depended on the alphabet of a random HMAC signature. That rate is derivable, so it is stated as a closed form rather than as a sample: HMAC-SHA256 is 256 bits and base64url-unpadded gives 43 chars, of which the first 42 each carry a full 6 bits (uniform over the 64-char alphabet, exactly 2 of which are `-`/`_`) while the 43rd carries only the leftover 4 bits (256 - 42*6) in the HIGH bits of its 6-bit group, low 2 bits zero, so it spans exactly the 16 alphabet indices divisible by 4 (`048AEIMQUYcgkosw`), never `-`/`_` at 62/63 (verified by encoding all 256 possible final digest bytes). Hence P(no `-`/`_`) = `(62/64)^42` = 26.4%, so roughly a quarter of tokens had only the signature replaced and the payload claims stayed verbatim in a URL that still looked complete but no longer authenticated; the other ~74% were emitted with no redaction at all. (An earlier 400-signature estimate published 29% here. Two 5000-mint runs land at 26.0% and 27.1%, straddling the closed form, so the published figure was a small-sample artefact.) The link token now has its OWN alternative, `(?<![A-Za-z0-9_.-])eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]{96,}\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]{43}(?![A-Za-z0-9_-])`, ordered AFTER the `{2,4}` one so a real JWS still redacts whole instead of matching `header.payload` and leaving `.signature` exposed. The `{2,4}` floor was deliberately NOT relaxed to `{1,4}`: the alternative has no left boundary and its post-header segments allow an EMPTY match, so `{1,4}` matches ordinary code and prose (`keyJson.get(raw)` becomes `k[REDACTED: credential](raw)`, and a JWT quoted at the end of a sentence loses its trailing period). The segment lengths come from the generator rather than from guesswork, because a length FLOOR alone is beatable by a verbose enough identifier: at `{40,}` the 40-char `eyJsonSerializerConfigurationFactoryBuilder.deserializeFromStringValue` matched. `token_auth._sign` is HMAC-SHA256 base64url-unpadded, so the signature is EXACTLY 43 chars for every token ever minted, a property of the digest and not of the payload, so it is pinned as `{43}`; `test_link_token_signature_is_43_chars` fails loudly if that digest changes rather than letting redaction silently stop matching. `generate_token` always emits `sub`/`exp`/`session_exp`/`iat`/`nonce`/`gen` with a 16-hex-char nonce and float timestamps (`app`, `prompt` and `extra` only add), so payload length is not fixed: it scales with `len(sub)` and with the repr width of each float timestamp, which base64 quantises into 4-char steps. The floor is therefore derived rather than sampled: a 1-char `sub` (the narrowest a caller passes), `gen=0`, and all three timestamps at their shortest 12-char repr (an exactly-integral `time.time()` in the current 10-digit epoch era) measures 145 chars past `eyJ`, leaving the `{96,}` floor 49 chars of headroom. ONLY that derived floor is pinned; live payload sizes are not, because the spread moves with float reprs and caller mix (measured 168-185 for the mandatory-only callers, and 192-223 for the two that also pass `app=`, which adds an `"app"` claim). `test_link_token_payload_clears_the_96_char_floor` pins the derived floor so a shorter claim set fails loudly instead of silently disabling redaction. The left boundary includes `.` so an attribute access (`obj.eyJsonReader.readValueFromInputStream`) is excluded. A false positive here is not purely cosmetic: `chat_runner.py` redacts file-diff chip bodies IN PLACE before persistence ("so both the live and persisted views are clean"), so a bad match is written to the persisted view with no recovery path. Artifact content and compressed history are redacted on the serialization/output path instead (`handlers/artifacts.py::_serialize`), so those surfaces are not rewritten on disk. The product's own link delivery is unaffected by construction: `slack/allowlist.py::send_dashboard_link` builds the presigned URL and posts it via `slack.post_message` without calling `redact_credentials()` (and `slack/client.py` does not redact internally), so `!dashboard` and `kirocrew token` are outside this path. What the fix closes is an agent-authored URL carrying a live token into chat, which is the XPIA data-exfiltration row of the threat table above
- Base64 detection: finds 40+ char base64 chunks, decodes them, checks if decoded content matches any credential pattern
- **Bare label-less secret-key detection** (`bf7b1baf`): a 40-char AWS *secret access key* (the value paired with an `AKIA`/`ASIA` ID) is a bare base64 run with NO prefix and NO `key=` label, so the fixed-format patterns above miss it when it appears standalone (echoed alone, in a log line, in a JSON array element). A third redaction pass adds an entropy + structural heuristic: `_BARE_SECRET_RUN_RE` isolates each `[A-Za-z0-9+/]{40,}` run (word-boundary look-arounds so surrounding prose is preserved), then `_looks_like_secret_key()` applies every gate below — a token must clear ALL of them (design bias is toward NOT redacting: a false negative reverts to prior behavior, a false positive corrupts benign output). Gates, cheapest-first: (1) length is EXACTLY 40 (AWS secret-key length); (2) contains lower + upper + digit (rejects all-lower prose, ALL-UPPER constants, base32, digit runs); (3) not an all-hex run (`_HEX_ONLY_RE` rejects 40-char git SHAs and 32/64-char md5/sha256 digests — verified even for mixed-case hex that would otherwise clear the entropy gate); (4) Shannon entropy ≥ `_SECRET_ENTROPY_MIN` (4.3 bits/char — real random keys average ~4.78 and rarely drop below ~4.4, while camelCase identifiers and file paths cluster at 4.0-4.3; the canonical AWS example scores 4.66); (5) does not base64-decode to ≥85% printable ASCII (`_decodes_to_printable_text` leaves encoded-text blobs to the decode-and-scan pass); (6) structural randomness — the longest run of consecutive lowercase letters ≤ `_SECRET_MAX_LOWER_RUN` (5) AND the vowel ratio ≤ `_SECRET_MAX_VOWEL_RATIO` (0.30). Both structural gates apply to EVERY token: unlike a naive design, the presence of `/` or `+` is **not** a free pass to redact, so a 40-char mixed-case file path (e.g. `src/main/java/com/Example/FooBarBazClas1`) — which contains `/` yet is built from dictionary-word segments with long lowercase runs — stays intact. The pass scans the ORIGINAL text (stable offsets) and skips any run already redacted by pass 1/2. Tests (`test_security.py::TestBareSecretKeyRedaction`) prove true positives on real secret shapes and NO over-redaction of git SHAs, UUIDs, sha256/md5 hex, base32, prose, code identifiers, or slash-delimited file paths. **Glued-secret sliding window**: `_looks_like_secret_key()` only accepts an EXACTLY-40-char token (gate 1) — its documented boundary assumption — but `_BARE_SECRET_RUN_RE` captures the *longest* base64 run, so a real 40-char secret glued to an adjacent base64 char with no delimiter (`X`+secret, secret+`A`, `SECRET=`+secret+`ABC`, secret+`X`+secret) forms a 41+ char run that fails the exact-40 gate and would leak verbatim. Pass 3 therefore gates each captured run through `_contains_bare_secret()`, which slides a 40-char window across the run and redacts the whole run when ANY window clears every gate; this stays linear (the regex yields disjoint spans). The sliding window does not over-redact >40-char benign camelCase identifier runs (no window within them looks like a secret)
- Applied on **every** output path — each boundary where agent output reaches a human or an external service. The authoritative list is the `redaction_paths` control in `security_posture.py` (see "Security Posture Detail Registry" below), which is what Settings → Security renders; do NOT restate the count as a literal here (this line read "ALL 5 output paths" long after the real number had multiplied, and the dashboard's hardcoded pill inherited that stale 5)
- **Cross-chunk streaming redaction** (`StreamRedactor`): per-chunk redaction misses a credential split across a token/streaming/Slack chunk boundary (a chunk ending `...AKIA` and the next starting `IOSFODNN7...` each individually escape `redact_credentials()`, so raw fragments reach WebSocket/SSE/Slack consumers). `StreamRedactor` is a rolling-buffer redactor: it withholds the trailing run of credential-class characters (`_CRED_CLASS` — letters/digits + URL/base64/connection-string punctuation, the possible start of a not-yet-complete credential) until a non-credential-class terminator arrives or the stream ends, then rejoins and redacts before emitting on the wire. Holdback is bounded by `_STREAM_HOLDBACK_MAX = 512` (larger than the longest fixed-format credential) so a split token is always rejoined; `flush()` redacts the buffered remainder at segment/stream end. Adds at most one chunk of latency. **Streaming JWT/JWE ceiling** (round-2 + round-3): JWTs (esp. RS256/ES256 with embedded claims) routinely exceed 512 chars, so a terminal token longer than the DoS floor would otherwise be bisected — the first `len-512` chars emitted raw before `flush()` redacts only the held tail. When the withheld tail matches `_PARTIAL_JWT_TAIL_RE` (`eyJ…` optionally followed by up to FOUR `.`-separated base64url segments — `{0,4}`, so a 5-segment compact JWE escalates too, matching the batch JWE ceiling — anchored to buffer end) the cap is raised to `_STREAM_HOLDBACK_JWT_MAX = 4096` so the whole token is rejoined before emission; the 512-char floor still applies to every non-credential run. **Split-Bearer holdback** (a8e5fe6a): an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header spans whitespace (not in `_CRED_CLASS`), so the cred-class run alone would commit the `Authorization: Bearer ` prefix and leak the token on the next chunk. `_BEARER_ANCHOR_PARTIAL_RE` (case-insensitive, JSON-aware, `\Z`-anchored, matching any prefix of an in-progress `Authorization: Bearer <token>`) makes `feed` pull the commit index back to the anchor start (`i = min(i, anchor.start())`), holding header + token together, and escalates the cap so an opaque OAuth/refresh/SSO Bearer token >512 chars (no `eyJ`) is not bisected either. **Fail-closed ceiling** (round-3): when a credential-anchored tail (JWT/JWE/Bearer) exceeds the 4096 ceiling, `feed` FAILS CLOSED — it redacts+emits the confirmed-safe prefix, appends `_REDACTED_CREDENTIAL_TAG` (`[REDACTED: credential]`, shared with the batch redactor), and DROPS the oversized tail rather than bisecting it; a plain cred-class run with NO credential anchor is still committed verbatim (bisected — no data loss, DoS bound intact)
- Defense against write-then-execute attacks: even if the LLM tricks kiro-cli into running a credential-extracting script, the output is scrubbed before the LLM can use it in follow-up messages

### Production npm Vulnerability Gate (`scripts/check_npm_audit.py`)

Pull requests, tagged releases, and nightly releases share one blocking production-dependency
control in `.github/workflows/dependency-vulnerability.yml`. The PR caller remains a job in
`code-review.yml`, so a failure contributes to the existing `Code Review` conclusion consumed by
`PR Readiness`. Release and nightly wheel and desktop builds both depend directly on the gate;
all publish, sign, and GitHub Release jobs are therefore transitively unreachable when it fails.

The gate audits all lockfile-backed Node applications independently:

- `website/package-lock.json`
- `website/electron/package-lock.json`
- `site/package-lock.json`

CI pins Node `20.19.4`, then invokes the exact npm package `npm@10.8.2` through `npx` with
`audit --omit=dev --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts --audit-level=high --json`. It neither
installs project packages nor runs project lifecycle scripts. High and critical production
findings block; information, low, moderate, and development-only findings do not.

**Fail-closed contract.** A missing `npx`, missing manifest or lockfile, timeout, subprocess error,
exit status other than npm's documented audit-result statuses 0/1, empty or malformed JSON, npm
`error` response, unsupported audit report version, inconsistent counts/status, broken advisory
reference, or high/critical record without a stable advisory identity fails the job. Exit 1 is
accepted only with a structurally valid report that contains high/critical findings. String `via`
references are recursively resolved to leaf advisories, cycles and missing references are errors,
and findings are deduplicated by lockfile, affected package, and advisory. npm registry/advisory
availability is consequently an explicit release dependency: an outage blocks rather than skips
the control.

**Exception contract.** `.vulnerability-exceptions.json` is validated before any audit against the
contract represented by `.vulnerability-exceptions.schema.json` and the stricter date checks in
the gate. The root has exactly `version: 1` and `exceptions`; each exception has exactly:

| Field | Contract |
|-------|----------|
| `package` | Exact npm package name; wildcards are forbidden. |
| `advisory` | Exact canonical `GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx` or fallback `npm:<numeric source>` identity. |
| `paths` | One or more exact audited lockfile paths from the list above; no duplicates. |
| `reason` | Trimmed 20–500 character risk justification and mitigation. |
| `owner` | Accountable GitHub `@user` or `@org/team`. |
| `expires` | Real ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` date, no more than 30 days ahead at validation time. |

An exception matches only the package + advisory + lockfile tuple; it cannot suppress another
package, advisory, or project. Duplicate scopes, unknown fields, unsupported paths, malformed
identifiers, or an expiry more than 30 days ahead invalidate the complete file. An expiry date is
valid through that UTC date; beginning the next UTC day, the stale entry fails the entire gate even
if its advisory is no longer reported. Renewal requires a reviewed edit that moves the date back
within the 30-day window and confirms the owner, reason, and mitigation remain current. Remove an
entry as soon as the dependency is fixed; Git history is the approval record.

Run the same control from the repository root with:

```bash
python scripts/check_npm_audit.py
```

The command contacts npm's registry/advisory service. Unit tests mock the subprocess boundary and
cover malformed output, operational failures, report resolution, schema constraints, expiry, and
exact-match exception behavior without network access.

### GitHub AI Review Human Overrides (`.github/workflows/`)

Human judgment is the final authority over the Fable 5 and GPT 5.6
AI-review results. A repository member with `write`, `maintain`, or `admin`
permission can record a false-positive, not-applicable, or accepted-risk
decision with:

```text
/ai-review override <fable|gpt|all> <current-sha>: <reason>
```

The decision is intentionally explicit and commit-scoped. The handler resolves
the current PR head and accepts a 7–40-character SHA prefix only when it matches
that head; the trusted record stores the full SHA. Any subsequent push therefore
invalidates the decision and causes normal AI review on the new commit.

**Trust boundary** — `.github/workflows/ai-review-human-override.yml` runs on
`issue_comment`, so GitHub loads it from the default branch. It never checks out
or executes PR-controlled code. Before changing a result it requires:

1. The exact command shape above and a non-empty, at-most-500-character reason.
2. A current-head SHA match.
3. The commenter to have `write`, `maintain`, or `admin` collaborator
   permission. PR authors receive no exemption.

After validation it posts a `github-actions[bot]` comment whose hidden marker
binds `{target, full head SHA, actor, source comment id}`. Reviewer workflows
trust only this bot-authored marker; a raw author or third-party comment cannot
turn a gate green. The handler has only review-control permissions
(`actions:write`, `checks:write`, `pull-requests:write`, and
`contents:read`), and receives no `id-token` or `contents:write`.
`pull-requests:write` is required for the handler to create the trusted record
on a pull request; `issues:write` alone does not make that write reliable for a
GitHub Actions installation token.

For Fable 5 and GPT 5.6, the handler re-runs the existing PR workflow. The
re-run resolves the trusted marker before acquiring AWS credentials, skips the
model invocation, updates the existing summary with a human-override banner,
and exits its original gate successfully. Either event ordering — an override
recorded before a reviewer starts, or one arriving during model execution —
leaves the SHA-scoped human decision authoritative.

The marker-keyed comments expose the override command to repository
writers. GPT 5.6 also normalizes each current-commit result into a
top verdict plus one sentence: `✅ no blocking findings`,
`🔴 changes requested (blocking)`, an incomplete state, or a human-override
state, so a green verdict from the previous commit is never left looking
current.

When no current-SHA override is active, GPT 5.6 captures convergence context
before replacing its marker-keyed comment: the prior bot review, prior
bot-recorded GPT/`all` override decisions, and recent review dispositions from
authors whose current collaborator permission is `write`, `maintain`, or
`admin`. Bodies are capped at 6,000 characters each and the complete bundle at
24,000 bytes. The two discovery outputs are likewise capped at 12,000 bytes
each before prompt assembly. The bundle is nonce-delimited and explicitly
untrusted: old SHA-scoped decisions are evidence only, never authorization for
a new SHA.

GPT still makes exactly three model calls. Passes 1 and 2 discover candidates;
pass 3 receives both bounded discovery outputs plus the bounded cross-round
context, rechecks the full diff, resolves contradictions, deduplicates, and
emits the only verdict exposed to the comment and gate. A materially identical
settled finding, or a reversal of earlier GPT guidance, must identify a concrete
changed-code or newly identified evidence delta; a new SHA alone is not a
delta. A prior disposition never hides a currently provable bug, but absent such
a delta the reconciler drops the repeated or contradictory finding. Any failed
call makes the three-pass review incomplete and leaves no current-SHA reviewed
marker, so the gate fails closed.

### Pull Request Readiness (`.github/workflows/` + `prepare-pr`)

`.github/workflows/pr-readiness.yml` publishes one current-revision answer for
the repository's fan-out of CI and AI reviews. The commit status context is
`PR Readiness`; the PR carries exactly one matching managed label:
`readiness: checking`, `readiness: action required`, or `readiness: passed`.
The workflow creates missing labels idempotently, replaces the prior readiness
label, and removes readiness labels when the PR closes. A passed label means
the automated lanes passed for that SHA; it does not represent human approval.
Making `PR Readiness` a required status remains an explicit branch-protection
or ruleset setting outside the workflow.

The aggregate covers the latest PR run for CI, Build,
Code Review, Opus 4.8 Review, GPT 5.6 Review (the reconciled result of its three
calls), and Design Review, plus the managed dynamic CodeQL workflow conclusion.
Grading the CodeQL
workflow conclusion, rather than its neutral summary check, preserves failures
from any managed Analyze job. Fork PRs cannot receive repository secrets or
OIDC credentials, and this repository's managed default-setup CodeQL workflow
is not scheduled for fork heads. The secret-backed AI reviews therefore run for
forks from the trusted base branch via the `fork-*` pipeline and are graded from
the head SHA's check-runs, leaving CodeQL as the only lane explicitly ineligible
for a fork. Missing or running eligible lanes
produce `checking`; blocking workflow/check failures produce
`action required`; drafts remain `checking`.
Design Review completion is required, but its verdict and
infrastructure conclusion are advisory. It emits one `PASS | CONCERNS | BLOCK`
verdict and no separate blast-radius rating, and it owns the long-term
reversibility (one-way-door) lens. Mergeability, behind-base state,
and human review decisions are not part of this event-driven aggregate because
they can change without an aggregate refresh event; branch protection and the
live `prepare-pr` status check own them.

Every event resolves the PR's current head through the GitHub API. An event
carrying an older expected SHA is ignored, so a late
run cannot relabel the new revision. A code-free `pull_request_target` handler
updates same-repository and fork PRs from the trusted base workflow. Actions
that start or restart validation for the same SHA, including a PR description
edit that re-runs Code Review, force the aggregate to `checking` before run
lookup so an older successful same-SHA run cannot keep readiness green. Trusted
base-repository `workflow_run` events refresh it as eligible lanes finish,
including the `fork-*` reviewer completions that carry a fork's verdicts.
Readiness-label events cannot recursively rerun or cancel a review: ignored label
events use a per-run concurrency key, so they cannot cancel an
active review or replace a pending authoritative reviewer event.

The bundled `prepare-pr` skill front-loads the same review contract before the
first push. Description/diff reconciliation and every allowed commit mutation
happen before review. After local gates, it dispatches two independent,
read-only subagents over the finished base-to-head diff: one owns correctness,
security, and platform compatibility; the other owns contracts, tests, error
paths, and the user workflow. Both use the canonical severity and output rules
from `.github/workflows/codex-review.yml`. Legitimate Critical/High findings are
fixed before publication; Medium/Low findings remain advisory unless a human
escalates them. If a blocker fix changes code, one focused verifier
checks that fix. The skill records the verifier-cleared SHA and fails closed if
HEAD changes before push; it does not start an unbounded local review loop.
During a post-submit round, it records one concise, marker-keyed GPT disposition
comment before re-pushing whenever findings were fixed or rebutted. That record
names the prior reviewed SHA, finding identity, outcome, and evidence so the
next reconciliation call can distinguish a real delta from a repeated argument;
the record remains untrusted evidence and does not carry an override forward.

`prepare-pr/scripts/pr_status.py` treats the aggregate status as authoritative
when present, including over stale failed or pending duplicate checks in
GitHub's rollup. Older PRs without the aggregate retain the fail-closed legacy
rollup behavior. Only the commit-status `context` named `PR Readiness` is
trusted as the aggregate; a same-named CheckRun cannot mask another failure.
Unresolved review threads are reported for visibility but are advisory rather
than an automatic readiness failure.

### Denied Commands (`security.py` + `hooks.py`)

138 first-class `DeniedCommandRule` records in `BUILTIN_DENIED_RULES` (`security.py`) — each a stable `id`, a Python regex `pattern`, a `category`, and a human `description` — blocking destructive and credential-exfiltrating operations. They are enforced **only** at KiroCrew's own `hooks.py` PreToolUse gate (`HookManager.on_tool_call` → `PolicyAuthority.is_denied`), never by kiro-cli. They are no longer a raw `deniedCommands` array injected into a kiro agent JSON, so there is no `execute_bash`/`shell` tool-settings copy and no project-dir `agents/defaults.json` override for them. Built-ins are **default-ON but user-DISABLEABLE** from Settings → Security (see "Denied-command rules, opt-out state, and read-only auto-approve" below). ada credential patterns are NOT in KiroCrew's denied commands — kiro-cli has its own built-in deny list for `ada credentials` that cannot be overridden via agent config.

**Credential exfiltration blocks**:
- `.*echo.*\$AWS_SECRET.*`, `.*echo.*\$AWS_ACCESS.*`, `.*echo.*\$AWS_SESSION.*` — env var echo
- `.*printenv.*AWS.*`, `.*env.*grep.*AWS.*` — env dump/grep
- `.*python.*boto3.*get_credentials.*`, `.*python.*botocore.*credentials.*` — script-based extraction
- `.*curl.*169\.254\.169\.254.*`, `.*wget.*169\.254\.169\.254.*` — IMDS metadata endpoint (coarse literal-string match)
  - **Encoding-aware IMDS gate** (`_check_imds_access` + `canonicalize_ip`): beyond the literal-string denies above, every IP-like token in a bash command is canonicalized to dotted-quad and compared to `169.254.169.254`, so alternate encodings the OS resolver/`curl` accept are blocked too — single-integer (`2852039166`), hex (`0xa9fea9fe`), octal per-octet, IPv6-mapped (`::ffff:169.254.169.254`), and the inet_aton **2-part (`169.16689662`) and 3-part (`169.254.43518`) short forms** (decimal or hex trailing component). The 2-/3-part forms are resolved via `socket.inet_aton` (the same resolver `curl` uses), which also rejects out-of-range forms (`169.254.11207422`) so benign hosts are not over-blocked.
- `.*curl.*\$AWS_SECRET.*`, `.*curl.*\$AWS_ACCESS.*` — credential exfil via curl
- `aws s3 cp .* s3://.*`, `aws s3 mv .* s3://.*`, `aws s3 sync .* s3://.*` — file upload exfiltration
- `.*cat.*/\.aws/.*`, `.*cat.*/\.ssh/.*`, etc. — direct credential file reads

**Allowed operations** (system prompt explicitly permits):
- `ada credentials update` — blocked by kiro-cli's built-in deny list (not KiroCrew). Users must run ada in their own terminal; `credential_process` in `~/.aws/config` handles automatic refresh for AWS CLI commands
- `ada profile add/list/print/delete` — also blocked by kiro-cli
- `aws sts assume-role` — cross-account access
- AWS CLI commands (`describe-*`, `list-*`, `get-*`, `filter-*`, `s3 cp`, `s3 ls`, etc.) — work via `credential_process`

**Destructive operation blocks**: `rm -rf`, `git push --force`, `aws * delete-*`, `aws ec2 terminate-instances`, `cdk destroy`, `terraform destroy`, etc.

**Structured-param synthesis (`_command_from_tool_params`, `types.py`)** — kiro-cli's `use_aws` tool is reported with `kind=execute` (making `is_shell=True`) but its params are the structured `{service_name, operation_name, parameters, region}` shape, not the `{command: "..."}` shape. Without synthesis, `AcpEvent.shell_command` returns None and the deny-by-default backstop fires on every `use_aws` call. The helper synthesizes `aws <service> <operation> [--region r] <serialized parameters> <positional args>` for the gate to evaluate:

- **Casing normalization**: `operation_name` is normalized PascalCase/camelCase → kebab-case via `_normalize_to_kebab()` before synthesis (e.g. `DeleteStack` → `delete-stack`). This prevents a casing mismatch from silently bypassing the kebab-case deny globs. `service_name` is NOT normalized because AWS CLI service names are already single lowercase tokens (`cloudformation`, `s3api`) and normalizing them would incorrectly hyphenate. The normalization is injective over the space of valid AWS API names so it cannot produce false collisions between a benign op and a denied one.
- **Whitespace fail-closed**: `service_name` or `operation_name` containing whitespace returns None (deny-by-default) rather than synthesizing a multi-token string that could confuse regex-based deny rules or produce shell-injection semantics in the synthesized string.
- **Best-effort caveat (serialized tail)**: the `parameters` dict is serialized via `json.dumps(sort_keys=True)` into the tail so the sensitive-path and exfiltration checks scan it (e.g. `cat ~/.aws/credentials` inside `ssm send-command` `commands`). However, JSON escaping (`\"`, `\\`) can render an embedded payload in a form the shell-text matchers were not authored for. This is acceptable for a single-user tool with operator consent (the human sees the tool call in the approval UI) but is NOT a complete smuggling defense. A future hardening pass could apply the shell-normalizer to the deserialized leaf values individually.
- **Half-formed shape fallback**: if either `service_name` or `operation_name` is missing/empty/non-string, synthesis returns None and deny-by-default remains armed.
- **Evidence note**: no captured event in the security event log contains the raw `operation_name` value (the SEL records tool names, not params). The kiro-cli binary strings contain PascalCase AWS SDK operation names (`GetId`, `CreateToken`, `DeleteStack`), and the tool spec states params "MUST conform to the AWS CLI specification" (kebab-case), but since the value is model-authored, BOTH casings can arrive. Normalization makes the assumption non-load-bearing.

- `is_denied(tool_name, extra_patterns, *, denied_regexes, reason_notes)` evaluates the *effective* denied-command set plus a dedicated verb-anchored git-publish detector. The **regex tier** (`denied_regexes`, matched via `re.search`, case-insensitive) is the enabled subset of `BUILTIN_DENIED_RULES` plus the user's `user_added` patterns from the keystone `denied_commands.json` opt-out state, which the hooks layer resolves via `compute_effective_denied(...)` and passes in; the **glob tier** (`extra_patterns`, fnmatch) carries legacy `auto_deny_tools` + the companion overlay. `reason_notes` is an optional `{pattern: operator note}` map (from `hooks.resolve_denied_notes`, forwarded opaquely by `PolicyAuthority.is_denied`) that decorates the refusal text only — it cannot add, remove, or alter a match. "Agent-configured patterns" no longer means a kiro agent JSON `deniedCommands` array — that injection path is retired. When `denied_regexes` is `None` the check fails closed to all built-ins enabled. The git-publish detector and protected-branch gate are unchanged always-on floors that run before either tier:

  - **Refusal string (a parsed micro-format, not free text):** the first line is always exactly `f"{DENY_REASON_PREFIX}{matched}"` — `DENY_REASON_PREFIX` is exported from `security.py` precisely so guards cannot drift from the producer. It is byte-stable on purpose, because three consumers parse it: `website/src/pages/chat/RecoveryCard.tsx` extracts the pattern with `/Blocked by security policy:\s*(.+?)\s*$/gm`, the test helper `_denied_by` partitions on the exact `"Blocked by security policy: "` separator, and `chat_runner` reads it for display (after redaction). When the matched pattern has an operator note, the note is appended as a **second line** — never on the first, which would be captured as part of the pattern. Because `RecoveryCard`'s regex is GLOBAL and per-line, a note containing the prefix would be parsed as a second, fabricated pattern; that is why notes carrying it are rejected at the endpoint and dropped in `resolve_denied_notes`. Both guards test `DENY_REASON_MATCH_PREFIX` (the colon-terminated form derived from the emitted prefix), NOT the emitted prefix itself: the regex makes the space after the colon optional, so `"Blocked by security policy:forged"` parses as a refusal line without containing the emitted string. Anything added to this format must keep line one intact.
  - **Git publish (verb-anchored regex):** `git push` is detected by `_is_git_publish()` (`_GIT_PUBLISH_RE` + `_GIT_PUBLISH_GLUE_RE`), **not** a substring glob. `push` must be the git *subcommand* (first non-flag token after `git`, allowing intervening `-x` / `-C path` / `-c k=v` options), so a commit message, branch name, grep pattern, or ssh remote payload that merely contains the word "push" is **not** blocked (e.g. `git commit -m '...push...'`, `git log --grep push`, `git switch -c fix/git-push`). Checked on the whole string first to catch command-substitution glue-evasion (`git$(echo ' ')push`, `git\`echo\`push`, `git_push`) and on segment-spanning chains (`git stash push && git push origin main`). Replaces the former broad `*git*push*` glob + ` stash push` exception, which over-blocked benign commands and surfaced as a silent `Tool use aborted` on the removed standalone provider.
  - **Protected-branch gate:** `_is_git_publish()` is a **pure, side-effect-free detector** — it only answers "is this a git push?". Whether the push is *allowed* (feature branch) or *denied* (protected/bare) is decided by `_is_push_to_protected_branch()` at the single enforcement point in `is_denied` (via a deferred `push_allow_pending` flag), which is also where **both** SEL audits fire: `_emit_deny_event` on deny and `_schedule_push_allow_audit` (SEL `push_allowed`, operation `git_push`) on allow. The `push_allowed` audit is deferred to the *final* allow exit, so a compound `<feature push> && <denied command>` chain that later trips a deny pass logs a **deny**, not an allow.
    - `_PROTECTED_BRANCHES` covers `main`/`mainline` plus the legacy Git default-branch name (see `_PROTECTED_BRANCHES` in `security.py`), plus ambiguous runtime-resolved refs `_AMBIGUOUS_REFS` = {`head`, `@`, `fetch_head`} — all matched by `_is_protected_branch_name()`. A push to any of these (or a **bare** `git push` / `git push <remote>` with no explicit branch, since the current branch might be protected) is denied.
    - `_PUSH_ALL_BRANCHES_FLAGS` = {`--mirror`, `--all`} are denied **outright** (they push every local branch, so a per-branch target check cannot vouch for them), kept in lockstep with the `--(mirror|all)` regex in `config/defaults.json`.
    - `_is_push_to_protected_branch()` splits the command with `_split_segments()` and validates **every** `push` segment / refspec (closing the `push origin feat && push origin main` bypass), normalizing `refs/heads/…` paths and `local:remote` refspecs; refspecs with shell/revision syntax (`$`, `` ` ``, `@{…}` — `_AMBIGUOUS_REFSPEC_RE`) are treated as ambiguous and denied. If a push was detected upstream but **no** clean segment parses, it denies to be safe.
    - **Force push:** a force flag (`--force` / `-f` / `--force-with-lease`) does not by itself make a feature-branch push protected (force-push to a feature branch is normal PR/rebase workflow), but force-push to a *protected* branch is still blocked because the target check fires regardless of flags.
  - **Self-protection (argv-structural floor, UNION with the regex tier):** the two rules that stop the agent disabling its own controls — `credential-exfil-kirocrew-token` (the `kirocrew token` CLI, which mints a signed dashboard access URL) and `self-protection-kill` (terminating the gateway/supervisor) — are enforced by **both** their `pattern` in the regex tier **and** a dedicated always-on predicate (`_is_credential_mint()` / `_is_self_kill()`). Neither half is sufficient alone, and the floor is deliberately **additive**, never a replacement:
    - **Why the floor exists.** These two rules must distinguish a dangerous *invocation* from an incidental *mention*, and raw-text matching cannot: the gap between the product name and the dangerous verb has to tolerate ordinary shell noise (a quoted verb `kirocrew "token"`, global flags, a redirection — bash accepts one anywhere in a simple command, so `kirocrew >/tmp/out token` is a mint), but any character class wide enough for that also spans a filesystem path, and a product-named worktree path (`…/kirocrew-wt-x/test_token_auth.py`) is the false positive the rules must not produce. Quoting cuts the other way too: `pkill -f '[;]*kirocrew'` is a working by-name kill whose quoted `;` textual splitting misreads as a command separator. The floor therefore tokenizes with `normalize_shell_command()` (resolving quoting, empty-string concatenation, `$HOME`/tilde) and matches on **argv**: for the mint, a token whose whole *program name* is `kiro[-.]?crew` followed by a later token in the same argv that is exactly `token`; for the kill, `pkill`/`killall` with the name in any argument (unbounded — the target is a pattern, not a path), or a bare `kill` whose PID comes from a command-substitution **body** naming it (walked with paren nesting, so `$(pgrep …)`, `$(pidof …)`, a pidfile read and backticks are all covered without allowlisting a resolver binary).
    - **Why the regex stays.** A shell's `-c` argument is a *command*, so `bash -c "kirocrew token"` hands the tokenizer one opaque token. The floor closes that class by re-tokenizing literal `sh`/`bash`/`zsh` `-c` payloads and `eval` arguments and checking those argvs too (`_self_token_frames`, depth-capped), but a payload that is not literal (`eval "$CMD"`) has no visible script, and the tokenizer itself can fail (unbalanced quotes). Keeping both `pattern`s in `regex_patterns` means a tokenizer failure or an unseen payload **fails closed** on raw text rather than open. `test_denied_commands_security.py::TestSelfProtectionFloorIsAdditive` pins this: the patterns must stay in the effective set, each pattern must be a true **subset** of its predicate (so the posture-UI text cannot drift from enforcement), and a simulated tokenizer failure must still deny.
    - **Platform note.** `normalize_shell_command()` expands `$HOME` via `re.sub` with a **callable** replacement, not a string. A str replacement is parsed as a template, and on Windows the home path (`C:\Users\…`) contains `\U` — an invalid escape — so a string replacement raised `re.error` for *every* input on that platform, silently emptying the token list and disabling both this floor and the git-publish normalizer second-pass.
  - **Interpreter argv literal (`credential-exfil-kirocrew-token-argv`):** a separate, narrow rule for the one shape neither half above can reach — an interpreter payload that spawns the CLI through a **library call** rather than as a shell word (`python -c "subprocess.run(['kirocrew','token'])"`, `node -e 'execFileSync("kirocrew",["token"])'`, `perl -e 'system("kirocrew","token")'`). The floor cannot help: the payload is one opaque token to the shell tokenizer and its contents are Python/JS, not shell. Scoped to the two words as **adjacent quoted arguments**, with a separator class admitting only what appears *between* argv elements (quote, comma, whitespace, opening bracket/paren) and deliberately excluding `.`, `*`, `/` and `>` — that exclusion is what keeps a regex **literal** quoting this very rule (`re.search(r'.*kirocrew.*token', cmd)`) and prose naming both words from matching, both recorded false positives. It carries a second alternative for the **single-string** spelling (`os.system("kirocrew token")`), which is **sink-qualified**: the two words inside one quoted string match only when that string is the argument of a call that EXECUTES it (`os.system`, `os.popen`, `subprocess.run`, `shell_exec`, `execSync`, `system`, `popen`, …). The sink prefix is what makes this safe — it is precisely what a regex literal, a commit message and `console.log(...)` lack, so those stay allowed while the executing form does not. A sibling rule `self-protection-kill-interpreter` does the same for a kill command (`os.system("pkill -f kirocrew")`). **Residual gap:** an interpreter that ASSEMBLES the name at runtime (string concatenation, a base64 blob, an HTTP call to the gateway) never contains it for any pattern to find. The un-disableable guarantee for this credential remains the sensitive-path floor over `token_signing.key`, which these rules do not replace. The sink set includes the asyncio spawners (`asyncio.create_subprocess_shell` / `_exec`, with the module prefix optional since the bare name is importable), which execute their argument the same way.
  - **Pass 1 (whole-string glob):** every deny glob is matched against the full input. If a pattern matches and no exception pattern also matches the full input, the command is denied immediately. This closes evasion vectors where the deny string spans a shell separator boundary.
  - **Pass 2 (per-segment glob):** only runs if pass 1 found a glob match AND the full input also matched at least one exception. The input is split on shell separators (`;`, `&&`, `||`, `|`, `&`, `$()`, backticks, newlines) into independent segments, and each segment is re-evaluated. `_DENY_EXCEPTIONS` is currently empty (the former git-stash carve-out is obsolete under the verb-anchored detector); the machinery is retained for any future scoped exception.
  - SEL audit events emitted on every denial (`deny_event`, recorded under the `git push` label for git-publish) and every exception grant (`deny_exception`).

**kiro-cli `autoAllowReadonly` removed.** The `toolsSettings.execute_bash.autoAllowReadonly: true` flag in `config/defaults.json` is gone — kiro-cli no longer self-approves read-only bash upstream of the gate (which would let those calls skip `hooks.py` entirely). KiroCrew now performs read-only auto-approve itself inside `hooks.on_tool_call`, placed **AFTER** the sensitive-path, deny-floor, and governance checks, so a deny always wins over the read-only fast-path (see "Read-only auto-approve" below).

**Agent-config injection retired.** KiroCrew no longer injects `deniedCommands` into `~/.kiro/agents/*.json`. `agent._enforce_denied_commands()`, the ~60s `CleanupHook('denied_commands', …)` re-enforce loop (`session.py`), and the `agent.enforce_denied_commands` config scope (`all`/`kirocrew`) are all removed. Enforcement is hooks-gate-only, so a kiro agent config that edits or omits `deniedCommands` cannot weaken KiroCrew's ceiling — the gate is authoritative (cross-ref `governance.md` Plane A/B).

### Denied-command rules, opt-out state, and read-only auto-approve

**`DeniedCommandRule` model** — a frozen dataclass in `security.py` with fields
`id: str` (a stable slug, e.g. `credential-exfil-s3-cp`; the opt-out key AND the
SEL audit key), `pattern: str` (a Python regex matched via `re.search`,
case-insensitive), `category: str`, and `description: str` (one human sentence
for the UI). `BUILTIN_DENIED_RULES: list[DeniedCommandRule]` is the canonical
default-ON catalog of **130** rules across categories `aws-destructive`,
`credential-exfil`, `iac-teardown`, `local-destructive`, `pipe-to-shell`, `sql`,
`self-protection`, `git-publish`, `reverse-shell`, and `sensitive-file-read`.
`BUILTIN_DENY_PATTERNS` is retained as a derived alias
(`[r.pattern for r in BUILTIN_DENIED_RULES]`).

**Effective-set resolver** — `compute_effective_denied(rules, disabled_ids,
disable_all, user_added, governance_pins)` is a pure, order-preserving, deduped
function returning the regex-tier list: include a rule's pattern if
`(not disable_all and id not in disabled_ids) OR id in governance_pins`, then
append `user_added` verbatim. Governance pins win — a pinned rule is re-added
even if the user disabled it or set disable-all (tightest-wins). The hooks gate
computes this once per tool call via `HookManager._effective_denied(ctx)` and
passes it as `denied_regexes` into `is_denied`.

**Opt-out state — keystone `denied_commands.json`.** The opt-out state is a
security ceiling, so it lives in its OWN keystone file
`~/.kiro/crew/denied_commands.json` (respecting `KIROCREW_HOME`) — NOT in the
agent-readable `config.json`. The file's root IS the opt-out object:

```json
{
  "disable_all": false,
  "disabled_ids": ["<builtin-rule-id>", ...],
  "user_added": [{"id": "user-xxxxxxxx", "pattern": "rm -rf /tmp/mine", "enabled": true,
                  "note": "use a scoped path instead"}]
}
```

`note` is optional operator prose, surfaced in the refusal when that rule fires so
the caller reads remediation instead of a raw regex. It is metadata: it never
participates in matching. Create-only, mirroring `pattern` — neither has an edit
endpoint. Two constraints follow from the refusal being a parsed micro-format
(see "Refusal string" below): the add endpoint collapses whitespace and rejects a
note containing `DENY_REASON_PREFIX` (`note_forges_reason`), and
`hooks.resolve_denied_notes` drops any note that still carries the prefix, which
is the guard that holds for a keystone file edited by hand.

The file is on `_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS` (read+write block) AND the governance
boot-integrity `required` tuple, so the agent can neither READ nor WRITE its own
deny ceiling via any shell form — it inherits the mature `is_sensitive_path`
gate (variable-indirection, symlinks, `KIROCREW_HOME`, interpreters, casefold,
realpath), at the same protection level as `security_policy.json`. This is why
NO bespoke bash write-matcher is needed (an earlier config.json-based approach
plus such a matcher was removed: a matcher over shell text can never be provably
complete, and the keystone floor closes the whole class).

- **Read (boot / cron):** `hooks_config_from_config_dict` parses the flat hook
  keys from config.json's `hooks` section, then OVERLAYS the opt-out state from
  `load_denied_commands_state()` (the keystone file). config.json's
  `hooks.denied_commands`, if any, is IGNORED — the keystone file is the sole
  source. Parsed into `HooksConfig` as `denied_commands_disable_all` /
  `denied_commands_disabled_ids` / `denied_commands_user_added` (list of
  `UserDeniedPattern`). Missing file / keys → the safe "nothing disabled" state
  (fail-safe for a deny gate).
- **Write (dashboard):** the 6 `/api/security/…` mutations run
  `_write_denied_state` — an atomic (0600) read-modify-write of
  `denied_commands.json` under the shared config lock; `_reload_live_hooks`
  splices the new opt-out fields onto the live `HookManager` (preserving its flat
  hook keys) so the change enforces without a restart. These operator endpoints
  open the file directly and do NOT route through the agent tool gate.

`HooksConfig.from_dict` remains **fully defensive** against malformed values
(type-checks every field; booleans — `disable_all`, the auto-approve flags, a
user rule's `enabled` — go through `_coerce_bool`, since `bool("false")` is
truthy in Python; unknown junk fails safe: `disable_all` → `False`, `enabled` →
`True`). The snapshot/handler read helpers apply the same normalization
(`disabled_ids` filtered to non-empty strings so a malformed `[{}]` can't raise
`TypeError: unhashable type`).

(config.json itself keeps its pre-existing write-only protection
`_WRITE_PROTECTED_HOME_PATHS` for its *resource-ceiling* fields, unrelated to the
opt-out state which no longer lives there.)

**Settings → Security UI** — the panel edits this state: a "disable all
built-in denies" toggle, per-rule toggles grouped by category (each category is
a collapsible accordion with a count, revealing the monospace pattern per rule),
and an add-your-own field for custom patterns. Built-ins are never deletable —
only disableable. Disabling a built-in (or the disable-all toggle) requires an
explicit acknowledgment in a confirm modal and writes a SEL audit entry
recording the weakened state. A governance-pinned rule renders locked (forced-on)
and cannot be toggled off. The seven `git-publish` category rules render the same
lock treatment for a different reason: their enforcement is the always-on
verb-anchored floor (`_is_git_publish` / `_is_push_to_protected_branch`), which
consults no opt-out state, so the snapshot forces them `enabled` and marks them
with `lock_reason: "floor"` (governance pins carry `lock_reason: "policy"`;
`pinned` keeps its governance-only meaning). `floor_enforced_builtin_command_ids()`
derives the set from the rule category — never a hand-maintained id list — and is
display/API-only: nothing in the enforcement path reads it. A `PATCH` disable for
a floor-enforced id is rejected with the same 409 shape as a governance pin
(`code: "floor_enforced"`, SEL-audited as denied with `=floor_enforced`) and
never persists into `disabled_ids`; re-enabling stays a no-op success. When *any*
rule is governance-pinned
(`governance_locked`), the **disable-all** toggle stays available and functional
(it shows the pinned-policy tooltip alongside the still-live control): the
backend keeps pinned rules enforced under `disable_all` via
`compute_effective_denied` (`(not disable_all and id not in disabled) OR id in
pins`), so a pin on one rule must not block opting every *other* (unpinned) rule
out.

**Live reload (no restart)** — a mutation hot-reloads the running
`HookManager` via `_reload_live_hooks` so the PreToolUse gate reflects the new
opt-out state immediately. The **heartbeat**-scoped manager
(`slack.gateway._build_heartbeat_hooks`, which drops the user's
`auto_approve_tools` so `HEARTBEAT_SAFE_TOOLS` is the sole approval authority) is
rebuilt **per heartbeat run** from the current primary manager — not snapshotted
once at init — so a just-disabled built-in or just-added user deny reaches
unattended heartbeat sessions without a gateway restart (cross-surface
consistency).

**Defense-in-depth nuance** — ~45 of the 130 rules overlap an independent,
always-on keystone control (sensitive-file reads, IMDS, git-publish, cred-env
dumps). Most rules are disableable, but disabling a rule does **not** disable
its keystone control — such a command stays blocked by defense-in-depth. The
`git-publish` rules go one step further: the floor is their *only* enforcement
(their ReDoS-prone patterns never reach the regex tier), so they are not
disableable at all and the Settings surface locks them (see above). The
~85 purely-opinionated destructive rules (AWS delete/mutate, `cdk`/`terraform`/
`pulumi destroy`, `rm -rf`, `DROP DATABASE`, kill-kirocrew, reverse shells) have
no keystone backup, so disabling those fully unblocks them (the actual user ask).

**Governance enterprise force-pin** — the Level-1 `security_policy.json`
`commands`-scope deny patterns are the enterprise force-deny. `hooks.py` reads
them via `_governance_pinned_command_ids(ctx)` (backed by
`governance.resolve_pinned_commands`) and unions them into the effective set, so
a pin overrides user opt-out via tightest-wins. Because `security_policy.json`
is on the `_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS` keystone (the agent cannot write it), a pin is
un-opt-out-able by construction. See `governance.md`.

A **Level-2 profile** can also pin a `commands`-scope rule. Two accessors keep
enforcement and display correctly scoped:

- `pinned_builtin_command_ids()` (ENFORCEMENT) — the **active ceiling only**.
  The hooks gate force-re-adds these ids (tightest-wins) so a user opt-out can't
  weaken a *ceiling* pin. It deliberately does NOT union other profiles' pins: a
  rule pinned only for profile A must not be force-enforced for profile B or a
  no-profile session. Per-*profile* command enforcement is handled separately by
  the gate's `_governance_denial` commands-scope deny plane, which resolves the
  *bound* profile.
- `pinned_builtin_command_ids_for_snapshot()` (DISPLAY) — the ceiling pins
  **unioned with the pins from all loaded profiles**
  (`governance_profiles.all_profile_pinned_commands()`). Used by the
  surface-agnostic Settings > Security snapshot (and the builtin-toggle 409
  check) so a rule pinned by *any* profile renders locked and rejects a disable,
  never surfacing as a no-op opt-out (UI success while the bound-profile gate
  still denies). This is display-only and does not widen enforcement.

**Read-only auto-approve** — now that kiro-cli's `autoAllowReadonly` is retired,
`hooks.on_tool_call` auto-approves read-only tool calls itself, as the **last**
branch before `allow()` — after every early-return deny (deny-by-default shell,
sensitive-path, sensitive-bash, exfil, write-protected-config, effective deny
set, governance). Position guarantees a read-only classification can never
re-admit anything the deny/governance gates blocked. For a shell tool it
auto-approves only when `command` is present and
`dashboard.state.is_read_only_bash(command)` is True (deny-by-default: rejects
redirects/substitution/backgrounding); for a non-shell tool when
`tool_kind in {"read", "fetch"}` or `slack.gateway._is_read_only_tool(tool_name)`
is True. Both classifiers are imported function-locally to avoid an import cycle.

Computer-use observation tools get their own **explicit** pair in that same
branch (`_cu_read_only_auto_approve`), keyed on the code-owned
`governance.computer_use_action_classes()` table rather than the
`_is_read_only_tool` title heuristic — that heuristic keys on a leading verb, and
an agent-supplied title must never decide whether a keystroke is synthesized into
somebody's window. It is additionally gated on the keystone primary enable, so no
auto-approval can exist while the feature is off. There is **no**
`computer_use.approval` ordinal and no approval-floor clamp helper: that row was
removed with the rest of the computer-use governance model, so nothing makes the
feature observation-only; see [governance.md](governance.md).

**The semantic `tool_kind` is an ALLOW-list, evaluated before ANY title-keyed
fast-path.** Only `tool_kind in _READ_ONLY_TOOL_KINDS` (`read`/`fetch`) auto-approves
outright; **every other non-empty kind returns `allow`** — i.e. falls through to
interactive approval — before the computer-use check or `_is_read_only_tool` is
consulted. A title-keyed branch is reachable only when the kind is **absent**.

**The computer-use auto-approve additionally requires an EXPLICIT read-only kind** —
it is reached only *under* that allow-list branch, never on an absent kind. Two
agent-controlled inputs meet there and neither may decide alone: the title, and the
absence of a kind (indistinguishable from an honest omission). They must agree.

Three findings shaped this, and all are worth keeping in view:

1. `tool_name` is the display title, and `select_tool_title` (`acp/_dispatch.py`)
   prefers the LLM-authored `description`, so it is **agent-controlled** — as
   `on_tool_call`'s own docstring states. The computer-use branch originally sat
   *above* any kind test, so once the operator enabled computer use, a mutating call
   titled `mcp__kirocrew-computer__computer_get_state` skipped the prompt entirely
   (verified for all six mutating kinds).
2. The first fix was a **denylist** (`kind in _WRITE_TOOL_KINDS` → `allow`), and it
   was still fail-open: `tool_kind` is passed through verbatim from the ACP `kind`
   field, so it is an arbitrary agent-influenced string and no enumeration of
   mutating kinds can be complete. `kind="other"` is a real ACP value and sailed
   past it. Hence the inversion — deny-by-default on the kind.
3. The allow-list still let an **omitted** kind through to the computer-use branch,
   so a `computer_click` could forge an observation title, send no kind, and
   auto-approve. Fixed by demanding the explicit kind. Deliberately *not* fixed by
   blocking absent kinds outright: the generic `_is_read_only_tool` fallback rejects
   every `mcp__kirocrew-computer__*` title anyway (asserted by a test, so it cannot
   quietly start matching), so a blanket block would have regressed every ordinary
   tool's "reads don't nag" behaviour for no security gain.

`_WRITE_TOOL_KINDS` survives as documentation of which kinds have been observed to
mutate; **the gate must not branch on it again**. Over-blocking here costs one
approval prompt, under-blocking costs the prompt that is the last thing between an
injected agent and a click. Pinned by
`test_hooks.py::TestMutatingKindBeatsTheTitle`, which asserts the unknown-kind cases
behaviourally AND asserts over the AST that `on_tool_call` references no
mutating-kind denylist.

### Computer use: a pixel/AX surface the path matchers cannot see

Native desktop GUI automation ([computer-use.md](computer-use.md)) is a security
surface unlike every other one in this module, and the difference is worth stating
plainly: **`is_sensitive_path` cannot see it.** A click has no path, a keystroke
has no command body, and a window's pixels have no filename. So none of the
mature matchers in this document apply — not the sensitive-dir regex, not the
relative-traversal block, not the symlink resolution, not the write-protected
tier. A Terminal window rendering `~/.aws/credentials` is, to the path gate, no
different from a text editor.

Three controls carry the weight instead:

1. **The app denylist is a floor in code** (`computer_use/policy.py::_DENIED_BUNDLE_PREFIXES`),
   matching by bundle-id PREFIX (so a helper process under a blocked bundle is
   covered) or case-insensitive process-name SUBSTRING (the Windows/Linux drivers
   may only ever learn a process name). Five categories: `terminal`,
   `credential_manager`, `system_settings`, `auth_prompt`, `kirocrew_self`.
   **`terminal` is refused for ALL verbs, reads included** — for two independent
   and individually sufficient reasons: a terminal window renders whatever the
   operator last `cat`ted as both AX text and pixels (and redaction only catches
   shapes it knows — it will not recognise an SSH private-key body or an opaque
   bearer token), and a keystroke into a shell prompt IS arbitrary command
   execution that never passes `hooks.on_tool_call`, bypassing the entire
   denied-command ceiling, the sensitive-path gate and the SEL audit of bash
   calls. `kirocrew_self` is there because KiroCrew's own dashboard can flip this
   feature's primary enable and the denied-command opt-out — controls that are
   out-of-band precisely so the agent cannot reach them. The list is
   operator-EXTENSIBLE (`extra_denied_apps` can only ADD) and never
   operator-shrinkable. There is no enterprise force-pin on top: the
   `computer_use.apps` ruleset was removed with the rest of that model, so
   `PolicyConfig.from_state` reads only `allowed_apps` / `extra_denied_apps` and the
   shipped entry plus the operator's own additions are the whole list.
2. **The secure-SUBROLE check**, and it must be the subrole. A real macOS password
   box reports `AXRole = "AXTextField"` (innocuous) with
   `AXSubrole = "AXSecureTextField"` and a **readable** `AXValue` — live-verified.
   So the intuitive `AXRole == "AXSecureTextField"` check **misses every password
   field**. The driver sets `secure = (role == SECURE_SUBROLE or subrole ==
   SECURE_SUBROLE)` and three protections key off that one flag: the renderer
   emits `<secure>` for the value (never the bytes, not truncated, not
   masked-with-a-hint), `policy.check_input_target` refuses
   `set_value`/`type_text`/`press_key` at a secure target, and a window containing
   ANY secure node gets **no screenshot at all** (whole-window suppression — there
   is no reliable way to blank a sub-rectangle of an already-encoded JPEG, and a
   partial redaction that missed would be worse than none). This floor has **no
   policy key and none will be added**: `resolve(None, None, …)` permits
   everything on an ungoverned host, so anything expressed only as a governance
   scope leaks by default for every single-user install. It belongs with
   `_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS` and the AKIA redaction, not with governance.
3. **The input-text scan as an explicit SECOND layer**, not the primary control.
   Text bound for another app's window is run through `is_sensitive_bash_command` →
   `audit_bash_exfiltration` → `is_denied` (called with `denied_regexes=None`, so
   it fails closed to the full built-in rule set — a user's opt-out from a bash
   deny rule is a decision about commands the AGENT runs under the tool gate, not
   a licence to type the same command into somebody else's window). This module
   already records the maintainers' position that chasing shell-parser
   completeness in a text matcher is a losing game, which is exactly why "refuse
   the app wholesale" comes first.

**Accepted residual — the screenshot directory stays agent-readable.** Persisted
JPEGs live in `<tmp>/kirocrew-computer-shots`, created `mode=0o700` with each file
passed through `platform_compat.restrict_to_owner` and ring-trimmed to 200 — but
the agent can still reach them with `fs_read`. This is the same posture browse
already ships; computer use widens WHAT can be in the frame (any window, not one
browser tab), which is bounded by per-window capture only (never full-screen) and
the whole-window suppression above. The design does not widen the posture and
does not claim to close it. A reviewer will find this independently, so it is
recorded here rather than left implicit.

Two further boundaries this module does **not** cover, stated so nobody assumes
otherwise: shell GUI automation (`osascript`, `cliclick`, `xdotool`,
`screencapture`, …) is a `commands`-scope item governed by the deny floor, never
re-parsed into GUI sub-effects; and the **web terminal PTY**
(`dashboard/handlers/terminal.py`) contains no `is_denied` /
`is_sensitive_bash_command` / governance call at all, so it is an operator-only,
ungoverned plane today.

### Suspicious Bash Patterns (`security.py`)

55 patterns in `SUSPICIOUS_BASH_PATTERNS` checked by `audit_bash_command()` at tool invocation time. Patterns with `*` use `fnmatch` glob matching; others use substring matching.

**Deletion patterns**: `find * -delete`, `find * -exec rm`, `find * -exec shred`, `xargs rm`, `git clean -f`, `shred `, `truncate `, `rm -rf /`, `rm -rf ~`

**Exfiltration patterns**: `curl * -d @`, `curl -d @`, `curl * --data @`, `curl --data @`, `curl * -F file=@`, `curl -F file=@`, `wget --post-file`, `nc * < `

**Pipe execution**: `| bash`, `| sh`, `| python`, `| perl`

### SEL Forward Callback (`sel.py`)

`set_forward_callback()` enables centralized log integration (basin/ktap). Events are redacted via `redact()` before forwarding to strip credentials and exfiltration URLs from string fields. Callback failures are logged at debug level (never silently swallowed).

### Credential File Permissions

`load_credentials()` in `loader.py` enforces `chmod 600` on `~/.kiro/crew/.env` at load time. If permissions are too open (group/other readable), they are tightened automatically. If `chmod` fails (e.g., file owned by another user), a warning is logged.

### Observe Mode Context Isolation

`channel_history.push` in observe-mode channels is gated on `_user_authorized`. Only messages from the owner or allowlisted users are recorded in the history buffer. This prevents non-owner messages from influencing LLM context via prompt injection through shared channel traffic.

### Slack Thread-Context XPIA Screening (commit 1fde6107)

When a new session starts inside an existing Slack thread, the handler fetches the thread-root message (`thread_parent_text`) and/or thread metadata (`thread_meta`) via `conversations.history` / `conversations.replies`. This content can be authored by **any** user — anyone who can post in a thread the bot participates in, not just the owner — so it is untrusted (XPIA) input. Beyond the existing `redact()` pass (credential/exfil stripping), `context.py:build_message` now:

- Screens both `thread_parent_text` and `thread_meta` with `security.contains_injection()` (a public wrapper over the shared `_INJECTION_PATTERNS` set, which lives in the dependency-free `vector_memory_constants` module and is re-exported by `vector_memory`) and **drops** the content on match; the parent branch then degrades to the bare thread-metadata block so the LLM still knows it is in a thread. The wrapper imports the pattern set at module top level and does **not** fail open — a screen that cannot run must not silently pass untrusted content through.
- Frames surviving parent text as **`[SLACK THREAD CONTEXT — UNTRUSTED DATA]`** wrapped in `<<<UNTRUSTED_THREAD_PARENT … >>>END_UNTRUSTED_THREAD_PARENT` delimiters, explicitly instructing the model to treat it as content to read and never as instructions to follow — instead of the prior "started by a prior session … here is what was posted" framing that presented it as trusted output.
- Emits a `prompt_injection_dropped` SEL audit event (`security.audit_injection_dropped()`, best-effort) whenever screened thread-parent or thread-metadata content is dropped, so attempted injection via shared thread surfaces stays visible in the audit trail.

### Mermaid Diagram Sandboxing

Mermaid `securityLevel` is set to `'strict'` in `MarkdownRenderer.tsx`, rendering diagrams inside an iframe sandbox. This prevents JavaScript execution from prompt-injected Mermaid diagram payloads.

### MCP Input/Output Validation (`validation.py`)

Centralized validation for all 12 MCP tool handlers (SDO-183):

- **Type-safe schemas**: `FieldSpec` + `ToolSchema` declarative validation
- **Unicode normalization**: NFC normalization + hidden character stripping (control chars, format chars, private use, surrogates — preserves `\n`, `\r`, `\t`)
- **Allow-lists**: enum enforcement for lesson categories, cron schedule kinds
- **Regex patterns**: agent name, job ID format validation
- **Range checks**: positive numbers for timeouts/intervals, valid timestamps
- **Length limits**: tool names (64), short strings (500), medium (5K), long (50K)
- **Unknown field rejection**: rejects unexpected fields in tool inputs
- **Response truncation**: 100K char limit prevents DoS from unbounded tool output
- **JSON-RPC 2.0 envelope validation**: request + response structure

### Foreign-Agent Import Boundary

Foreign-agent import treats every discovered file and database as untrusted
local input. The source catalog is fixed to Codex, Claude Code, MeshClaw,
OpenClaw, and Hermes; Quick and unknown source ids are not accepted. The
category catalog is likewise fixed to sessions, memories/preferences,
workspaces, MCP servers, user-authored skills, compatible schedules, and the
strict settings allowlist.

OpenClaw current discovery is restricted to `~/.openclaw` or normalized
`~/.openclaw-<OPENCLAW_PROFILE>` state, its JSON5 `openclaw.json`, and the
explicit `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`/`OPENCLAW_HOME`/`OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH`/
`OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR` overrides. The `"default"` profile means unprofiled
state. Only the documented `.clawdbot` legacy root with `clawdbot.json` or
`openclaw.json` is retained. `.moltbot`, implicit `openclaw.json5`,
`config.json`, root `mcp.json`, top-level sessions, and guessed root databases
are not scanned.

`GET /api/onboarding/import/scan`, `POST /api/onboarding/import/apply`, and
`PUT /api/onboarding/import/state` all require normal dashboard
authentication. Apply revalidates source/category selection and current
filesystem state instead of trusting scan output or client-supplied paths.

Security invariants:

- **No secret movement:** credentials, tokens, cookies, literal MCP environment
  values/headers, security policy, governance profiles, admission/deny state,
  and other secret-bearing records are reported by category/reason only and are
  never returned as values or copied.
- **No executable authority:** hooks, native agents/personas, raw
  instructions/system prompts, tool transcripts, approval state, provider
  sessions, and runtime/security state are never imported.
- **Constrained projections:** sessions keep visible user/assistant text only;
  memory goes through native writers/limits; workspaces must resolve to valid
  existing non-sensitive directories; MCP requires exactly one secret-free
  stdio/HTTP transport and cannot replace managed servers; skills are
  user-authored, source-namespaced, traversal-safe, and symlink-safe; schedules
  are rejected whole when foreign execution, routing, repetition, provider, or
  security semantics cannot be preserved, semantically deduplicated, and
  created disabled; settings use a strict non-security allowlist and preserve
  existing values.
- **Bounded databases:** before a supported foreign SQLite store is opened, its
  main file and present `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars must be regular non-symlink files
  whose aggregate size is at most 64 MiB. Unsupported durable stores, including
  Hermes `memory_store.db`, are diagnosed without opening them. MeshClaw active
  memory rows are capped across both supported tables before either contributes
  import candidates.
- **Merge-only and idempotent:** existing KiroCrew data wins. A provenance
  ledger prevents replayed source items from creating duplicates and carries no
  grant of trust or permission.
- **Read-only source:** scan/apply never rewrite, move, delete, chmod, or
  otherwise mutate a foreign source tree. Unsupported, malformed, secret, or
  over-limit entries are skipped and reported rather than coerced. Malformed
  JSONL invalidates the complete file and any workspace provenance collected
  from its prefix. Symlinks and Windows reparse points/junctions are rejected at
  source traversal and destination skill ancestry boundaries.

Import is not a governance bypass. Every imported artifact is still subject to
the destination's ordinary security checks and to the effective
`POLICY ∩ PROFILE` ceiling; imported data cannot weaken either level.

### Dashboard Authentication & Authorization

**Dashboard URL config** — single `dashboard.url` field in `config.json` (e.g. `http://my-host.example.com:8080`). Hostname, port, local-only mode, and allowed origins are all derived from this URL. When not set, defaults to `localhost:5476`. `KIROCREW_PORT` env var overrides the port (dev mode).

**SSH tunnel instructions** — All SSH tunnel commands printed by `kirocrew gateway` and `kirocrew doctor` now use the `-N` flag (`ssh -NL ...`) to suppress remote shell allocation. The tunnel purely forwards the port without opening an interactive session on the remote host.

**Local-only resolution** (`origin.py:is_local_only()`):
- No Slack → always local-only (no auth layer available)
- Loopback host in URL (localhost, 127.0.0.1, kirocrew.localhost) → local-only (`127.0.0.1`)
- Non-loopback host or auto-detect on remote machine → all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`)

**Token authentication** (`token_auth.py`):
- HMAC-SHA256 signed tokens with dual expiry: 5-minute link click window (`exp`) + session TTL up to 20 hours (`session_exp`)
- `!dashboard` and `/kirocrew dashboard` available to owner and allowed users; link always sent via DM (never in channel)
- First use: validates `exp` (5-min window), binds IP, marks consumed, sets `mc_token_{port}` cookie with `max_age` from `session_exp`
- Subsequent requests: validates `session_exp` via cookie
- `parse_duration()` caps at 20 hours max (MAX_SESSION_TTL_SECS = 72000)
- Loopback access trusted only in local-only mode (SSH tunnel); on all-interfaces mode, all requests require a token
- `token_auth_middleware(local_only)` — single boolean controls all auth behavior
- **Secure cookie flag via `origin.is_https_request()`**: the `mc_token_<port>` cookie (and the refresh cookie) set `Secure` only when the request is HTTPS — `is_https_request(request)` returns True for a direct HTTPS request, or when `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` is present **and the immediate peer is loopback** (a TLS-terminating tunnel/proxy forwarding into the loopback-bound gateway). Plain-HTTP localhost must NOT set `Secure` or the browser refuses to send the cookie back

**Per-session logout (CWE-613)** (`token_auth.py`): the access cookie is a self-contained HMAC-signed token, so clearing it client-side (`Set-Cookie max_age=0`) does not stop a saved copy replaying until its `session_exp` (up to 20h). `RevokedNonceStore` is a persisted denylist of explicitly-revoked access-cookie nonces (`token_revoked_nonces.json`, mode `0600`, survives gateway restart; each entry stores the token's own `session_exp` as an eviction floor so the file cannot grow unbounded). `POST /api/auth/logout` → `revoke_access_cookie()` validates the token, then records its nonce; `validate_token` (cookie path) is **deny-by-default** — a token whose nonce is revoked, or that carries no nonce at all, is rejected. Link-click token exchange also mints a SEPARATE session cookie (fresh nonce, `register_nonce=False`) rather than reusing the one-time URL/link token as the long-lived cookie, and denylists the consumed link nonce so a captured link copy cannot be replayed as `mc_token_<port>` (the query-param LINK path does not consult the denylist, so legitimate re-navigation of the same link URL within the 5-minute window still re-exchanges for a fresh session cookie).

**Pull-request provider authorization and audit** (`dashboard/handlers/source_providers.py`): every full-source read, checks read, review-thread mutation, and background sidebar refresh may inherit host `gh`/`glab` credentials. Which instance those credentials may reach is not browser-controlled: `github.com` and `gitlab.com` are always accepted, and a self-managed GitLab host is accepted only when its exact `host[:port]` appears in the operator's deny-by-default `dashboard.gitlab_hosts` allowlist. Adding an entry is an explicit operator decision to let the local `glab` CLI reach that host, including one only resolvable on the internal network; the allowlist is matched exactly (no suffixes, wildcards, or `www.` stripping), malformed entries are dropped at config load rather than sanitized, and `_run_json` re-checks the host before spawn so a code path that skipped URL validation is denied instead of reaching an unauthorized instance. A self-managed target additionally loses `GITLAB_TOKEN` from the provider child environment: the variable is a single ambient credential with no host binding, so forwarding it alongside a redirected `GITLAB_HOST` would disclose a gitlab.com PAT, and every permission it carries, to the self-managed server. Those hosts authenticate from their own per-host entry in glab's config. Direct source APIs require the explicit empty `request["app"]` dashboard claim. With a configured `DashboardState.owner_id`, reads and mutations require exact equality with `request["user"]`. With no configured owner, only full-source and checks reads accept the signed machine-local bootstrap subjects `local-app` and `local-startup`; review-thread mutation remains denied. Machine-local startup and local-secret token issuance use the configured owner id as their subject when one exists, so the auto-opened dashboard and `kirocrew token` satisfy the same exact owner check. Missing claims, non-owners, app tokens, unrelated local subjects, and every unconfigured-owner mutation fail closed with 403. Every direct API attempt makes a best-effort SEL access record with only the caller, operation, and coarse reason. URL, thread id, provider text, and credentials are omitted. SEL write failure cannot weaken an authorization denial or replace the request's response or exception. Cancellation during request-body parsing or provider work is recorded as `failed/request_cancelled` when SEL is available, then the original cancellation is re-raised.

`_run_json()` emits credential-free SEL tool-invocation lifecycle events around every provider CLI attempt. Unsupported providers, invalid bounds, Windows sandbox absence, untrusted executables, and sandbox rejection record `denied`. An allowlisted command awaits its synchronous critical `invoked` append on a worker thread immediately before spawn, so an audit filesystem failure denies execution rather than launching a credential-bearing process unaudited, without blocking the gateway event loop. Cancellation while that worker is active remains fail-closed and waits for it to settle; if `invoked` landed, cleanup records `failed/request_cancelled` before re-raising and never spawns the provider. Provider launchers run in a dedicated process group, and timeout, output-overflow, and cancellation cleanup kills and reaps the complete launcher/provider tree so a sandbox wrapper cannot leave `gh` or `glab` orphaned on an unread pipe. Successful JSON decoding records `completed`; spawn, output, timeout, nonzero exit, decode, cancellation, and internal errors record `failed` with only a coarse reason. Audit records contain the logical provider (`gh`/`glab`), not argv, URL, repo path, output, environment, token, thread id, or exception text. Terminal audit failures are best effort and never alter an already-completed provider result.

Sidebar status follows the same read-only boundary. `GET /api/chat/slots` and the WebSocket handshake schedule provider refreshes and opt into cached `ci`/`state` fields only for an exact configured-owner request, or for signed `local-app`/`local-startup` dashboard subjects when no owner is configured. Generic slot serialization omits those fields. `DashboardState` tracks owner-authorized WebSockets separately, sends generic slot updates to all authenticated clients, then overlays credential-backed status only to the owner subset. This prevents a cache populated by an owner request from being replayed to a non-owner or app-token caller. Review-thread cache removal, generation advancement, and stale in-flight detachment still complete after thread ownership validation and before mutation dispatch, so cancellation cannot preserve or repopulate pre-mutation data.

**App-token least-privilege scope (CWE-269)** (`token_auth.py`): an app token is confined to its own app namespace + the API path prefixes the app declares in its manifest `permissions.api` allowlist; everything else is denied. `_enforce_app_scope()` is **deny-by-default** — `_app_api_allowlist()` returns an empty tuple on any failure (app not installed, manifest unreadable), confining the app to its own namespace only. Enforced at all grant points (the normal cookie/query-param flow and the cross-app `/apps/<other>/api` reverse-proxy path re-check); dashboard-user tokens (empty `app` claim) bypass the gate entirely. Denials emit a `log_api_access` SEL event (`operation="app_scope_check"`, `outcome="denied"`).

**Kiro prerequisite setup boundary (`kiro_prerequisite.py`)**: the dashboard's
status/install/login endpoints require the exact configured owner. Before an
owner exists, only the signed `local-app` and `local-startup` dashboard subjects
may use them; generic dashboard-user and app-token callers are denied and
audited. The two mutations also pass the shared Origin/Referer CSRF check. They
expose exactly three fixed verbs and accept no request-selected executable,
argv, installer URL, redirect downgrade, output path, or shell fragment.
macOS/Linux download only `https://cli.kiro.dev/install`; Windows downloads only
`https://cli.kiro.dev/install.ps1`. Every redirect and the final URL must remain
on the exact `cli.kiro.dev:443` host and expected path, with no credentials,
query, or fragment. Automatic redirect following is disabled: each `Location`
is resolved and validated before its destination request, with a three-redirect
limit. The downloader rejects oversized bodies, supports explicit HTTP(S)
proxies while bypassing `.netrc`, then requires both a release-pinned SHA-256
digest and the platform-specific official marker. An upstream installer change
therefore fails closed until KiroCrew updates the pin. The same validated bytes
remain in memory and execute through the fixed system interpreter's standard
input, closing the validation/execution replacement window. The unsandboxed
official installer receives a system-only `PATH`. Explicit login
inherits only the allowlisted user-path, UI/device-flow, TLS, and proxy values;
passive probes receive a narrower environment that excludes proxy credentials
and desktop-session IPC as well as ambient cloud, Slack, SSH-agent, and
application credentials.

Output and client-visible errors are bounded and credential/exfiltration-
redacted. Only HTTPS URLs on the exact official `app.kiro.dev` host or the
`/start` device path on `view.awsapps.com` are linkable. User-triggered
install/login records a critical `invoked` SEL event before spawn (audit failure
denies execution), followed by a best-effort terminal event. Passive
`--version`/`whoami` probes use the same paired audit lifecycle; probe events
contain only the probe kind and coarse outcome, never argv, candidate path,
output, or environment. One operation may run at a time. Filesystem candidate
and interpreter discovery runs off the asyncio event loop. Timeout,
cancellation, and gateway shutdown terminate and reap the full child tree using
`platform_compat`. A private POSIX supervisor remains the process-group leader
until all group members exit, so a pipe-holding descendant cannot outlive an
exited command leader or turn a retained PGID into a reuse hazard. The gateway
captures the supervisor source before agent sessions begin and
invokes it from memory with isolated Python; the supervisor wraps the completed
sandbox launcher as the outermost process, resolving a sandbox or cgroup
wrapper's executable to an absolute path before the supervisor's `execve`.
An agent cannot replace a mutable
supervisor file immediately before an owner-triggered operation, and the Linux
namespace launcher and supervisor never wait on each other.
Windows synchronously retains an identity-stable handle for the primary process
after spawn, and successful process completion awaits the descendant tracker
until every retained child is inactive and terminally scanned. An immediate-exit
launcher therefore cannot disappear before its helpers are anchored or report
success while a detached installer remains live. Discovery continues from every
live child, so late helpers are still terminated before the deadline. Each exact
root receives one final post-exit snapshot before tracking removes it, closing
the between-polls child spawn/parent exit race. Every Toolhelp parent-PID edge is
checked twice against
creation and exit times read from the exact root, retained-parent, and
newly-opened child handles. Genuine children created before an immediate-exit
parent remain eligible, while a child attached to a recycled root or
intermediate PID is rejected. Failure to retain the primary handle or validate
its identity, create a Toolhelp snapshot, or complete any initial or later
enumeration fails the operation closed; opened child handles are closed before
the error propagates. One deadline covers process exit, initial and terminal
discovery, and inherited output-pipe closure.

Unverified candidate version probes route through
`sandboxed_spawn_argv(..., mode="strict")` on POSIX. The outer sandbox launches
an unverified candidate through the absolute system `/usr/bin/env` entrypoint,
preventing a planted `kiro-cli` basename from selecting the provider's trusted
internal macOS delegation path. The strict wrapper additionally hides the
configured data home, `~/.kiro/crew`, `~/.kirocrew`, and all known Kiro
identity stores, so setup probes cannot read Kiro Crew state or bearer tokens.
Trust is "the CLI runs, and it has a valid login": a Kiro CLI that answers
`--version` is eligible for `whoami` and device login, regardless of install
source, owner, or fixed path. KiroCrew is not the authority on where Kiro CLI
is installed, and Kiro CLI's own self-updater legitimately rewrites its bytes as
the user — so an install-source/owner/path/Developer-ID gate would strand real
installs (toolbox, Homebrew, winget, a self-updated `/Applications` bundle) with
no in-product recovery path, which is the concrete first-run/reauth dead end
this model removes. `whoami` reporting a valid session is what makes readiness
true; a runnable CLI never surfaces an unreachable "repair" state.

**The Kiro CLI is always executed IN PLACE, on every code path** (ACP spawn, auth
commands, `whoami` probes, `/usage`, `--list-models`) — never from a private copy.
The earlier design copied the resolved bytes into a per-call directory below the
staging parent, or into `<data-home>/run/kiro-cli-snapshots` (a sealed memfd on
Linux), and executed the copy, binding the launched process to the bytes just
resolved. That resolve-to-exec byte-binding is **removed**: Kiro CLI 2.15+ is a
multi-call binary that dispatches by exec'ing a sibling `kiro-cli-chat` resolved
relative to its own path, so a copy into a flat directory made every spawn fail
with ENOENT. The TOCTOU it closed requires an attacker who already has write
access to the user's own machine — outside this product's threat model, and not
defended against elsewhere — so the copy is not worth the breakage. Do NOT
reintroduce it. Installation still refuses a no-op (unchanged-digest) or shadowed
install so the Install button cannot silently succeed without producing a working
target.
Auth commands use `mode="standard"`; the fixed `~/.kiro/crew-auth-staging`
parent is on the shared sensitive-path floor and hidden by every agent sandbox.
Sign-in is delegated to Kiro CLI: `login --use-device-flow` runs against the
user's real home and environment with only the Kiro Crew data homes — the
configured home, `~/.kiro/crew`, `~/.kirocrew` — hidden, and the CLI writes
its own credential store where it normally keeps it. KiroCrew stages no
credentials and copies none back, so there is no publication step, no
cross-gateway publication lock, no pre-publication identity-generation scan, no
SQLite backup-API republish, and no "identity changed during sign-in" conflict
for two racing gateways to hit. The real-home run is a subset of an accepted
surface rather than a new one: ACP launches the same resolved Kiro CLI with the
full real environment under the same standard sandbox on every agent session. A
credential-minimal temporary home remains available as an opt-in read-only mode
for callers that must never see the real `~/.aws` / `~/.ssh`: its random
per-call workspace below the staging parent receives HOME/XDG/AppData and holds
only the allowlisted `kiro-auth-token*.json` and Kiro CLI identity SQLite files,
the identity stores are hidden on top of the Kiro Crew data homes, and the
workspace is removed on every exit path — success, failure, timeout,
cancellation, or exception. A matched live identity file that cannot be captured
under the bounded regular-file rules aborts that staging path before the command
runs; it is never omitted as though absent. No production caller currently
selects the isolated mode, since the readiness probe also runs real-home.

The Kiro CLI identity database (`data.sqlite3`) is **projected, never
byte-copied**, and is therefore deliberately exempt from the
`_MAX_AUTH_STORE_FILE_BYTES` (64 MB) cap that governs every other staged
identity file. That database is the CLI's main store: identity occupies two
small tables (`auth_kv`, `migrations`), while `history` / `conversations*` hold
chat transcripts and grow without bound — a real user's store reached ~429 MB.
Byte-copying it both aborted sign-in for those users (with a message naming
neither size nor cause) and read the whole file into memory to write it straight
back out. Projection copies every table/index **DDL** plus the **rows** of the
identity tables only, so the staged file is bounded by the identity data alone
however large the source grows, and the sandboxed CLI receives no transcript
content. `state` is a mixed key/value table — a few rows describe *which*
identity is signed in (Identity Center region + start URL, CodeWhisperer
profile) and the rest is unrelated local state (telemetry ids, onboarding flags,
prompt counters) — so its rows are carried **selectively by key prefix**
(`auth.`, `api.codewhisperer.`), letting `whoami` render its full profile block
without handing the sandboxed CLI the user's telemetry identifiers. The match is
by prefix rather than an exact key list so a newly added `auth.idc.*` key is
carried automatically instead of being silently dropped; `state` itself is
optional, so an older schema without it still stages. The full schema is copied rather than just the identity tables because
`migrations` is projected with its rows: the CLI then treats the schema as
already current and runs no migration, so a store holding only identity tables
would fail with `no such table: history` on first use. Projection keeps the byte
path's defenses — reject a symlink, require a regular file, open read-only — and
creates the destination `0o600` before writing, so identity rows are never
briefly world-readable. A source that is unreadable, is not a database, or
is missing **any** required identity table fails closed and aborts staging,
rather than handing the CLI an empty store it would read as signed-out. The
all-or-nothing table check is deliberate: a future Kiro CLI that renamed one
identity table while keeping the other would satisfy an any-of check and stage a
store whose schema is present but whose identity rows are absent — silently
producing the signed-out outcome the check exists to prevent. Requiring all of
them turns a schema change into a loud abort instead. Consequently the SQLite
sidecar filenames are no longer staged: reading through SQLite already applies
any pending WAL/journal state.

The source is opened `mode=ro` **without** `immutable=1`, deliberately.
`immutable=1` would guarantee no sidecar is ever touched beside the user's live
database, but it also asserts the file cannot change, which makes SQLite **ignore
the `-wal`**: against a store in WAL mode whose newest commits are still
WAL-resident, the token row reads as missing and the staged store presents as
*signed out* — a worse failure than the size abort this projection replaces.
Plain `mode=ro` applies the WAL, so the staged identity always matches what the
CLI itself would read. The accepted cost is that SQLite may create or refresh the
`-shm` shared-memory index beside the live database exactly as any other reader
does; `-shm` carries no identity data, and no bytes are ever written back to the
user's store. A regression test pins the WAL-resident case.
Candidate discovery spans the inherited `PATH`, interpreterScripts directory, and explicit operator override on every OS — a runnable
candidate from any of these is eligible, since trust is "it runs". Status
requests never mutate `KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN`. Electron delegates entirely to this
gateway service and does not execute a second candidate or installer path. For
each local-token request Electron re-resolves the authoritative migrated or
pinned data home, reads exactly that home's one bootstrap secret, and sends it
only to the literal `127.0.0.1` gateway bind address; it never probes canonical
and legacy secrets across multiple loopback addresses. ACP launch does not
re-impose a provenance gate: the shared client/runtime resolver accepts any
runnable candidate and canonicalizes symlinks before its final no-follow open.
Every platform then launches that candidate **in place** — the resolved path
itself, never a private copy of its bytes (see the in-place launch record above:
a multi-call Kiro CLI resolves its sibling subcommand executable relative to its
own path, so a copy strands it). Explicit Kiro classification preserves
internal-sandbox delegation without relying on the executable basename. There is
deliberately **no** resolve-to-exec byte-binding and no install-source/owner
gate: arbitrary unsandboxed same-user native code is outside the enforceable
in-process boundary regardless, gating on origin only strands legitimate
self-updating installs, and a swap between resolve and exec requires local write
access this product does not defend against anywhere else. This is an operator-triggered
system prerequisite, accepts no LLM input, and is absent from the headless MCP
server route set.

**App manifest permission model — advisory (`apps/permissions.py`)**: distinct from the HTTP app-token scope above, the App Kit manifest `permissions` block (`mcpTools`, `network`, `memory`) is currently **advisory, not enforced in-process**. `validate_permissions()` and `format_permissions_summary()` exist but are **not wired into the install or runtime path** — they have no callers outside `test/`, so the manifest `permissions` block is neither enforced nor even surfaced today. `check_tool_permission()` **fails open on an empty `mcpTools` allowlist** (returns `True`) and is not called at the tool-dispatch boundary, so `mcpTools` is a review/display signal rather than a runtime capability gate. (Install-time path-traversal blocking is a separate mechanism: `_check_path_safety(name)` + `manifest.validate()` in `_validate_source_path`, not the permission validator.) Real in-process enforcement (and per-resource `owner_app` ownership) is tracked in `docs/request-for-change/rfc-app-sandbox-isolation.md`; today an installed app runs with the user's full trust, confined only by the HTTP app-token scope, the OS sandbox, the `agent.apps_allow_third_party` off-switch, and destructive-command deny patterns (TRACKING).

**Third-party app execution boundary (`apps/execution.py`)** (CSE SEC-012): admission and governance decide which apps may be installed/activated; this separate runtime boundary decides whether admitted app code may execute. `agent.apps_allow_third_party` defaults to `false`, and only the literal JSON boolean `true` is an explicit grant (truthy strings/numbers and environment variables do not admit). `app_execution_denied()` is the shared provenance/config/audit decision used before in-process module loading, backend dependency setup/adoption/spawn, lifecycle shell commands (`onEnable`/`onDisable`/`onUninstall`), registry detection/build/`onInstall` commands, and `openCommand`. `enable_app()` evaluates it before persisting `enabled=true`, so denial leaves metadata, resources, dependencies, scripts, hooks, and backends untouched; `handle_open_app` separately requires the app already be enabled. A config-load error fails closed. Positively identified shipped builtins are exempt. Every denial emits one `app_execution_admission` SEL event carrying the app and action. Self-registration cannot claim `origin=builtin`; that provenance is reserved for `register_builtin_apps()`. **Wire identifier:** a denial that reaches the dashboard carries the stable machine-readable `code: "app_execution_denied"` alongside its advisory `error` prose — emitted by the `openCommand` route, by `install_from_registry`, and by `AppResult.to_dict()` (which serializes `error_code`) for `enable`. The frontend keys its "allow this in Settings → Security" affordance off that code, never off the prose, so the sentence stays free to be reworded; renaming the code is a breaking UI change.

**App admission gate (`apps/admission.py`)** (CWE-829): a contained App Kit admission decision core, gating the app install / update / enable / `register_external_app` / registry paths. It is **distinct** from the CPP-seam plugin admission engine (`platform/admission.py`), which gates signed plugin entry-points from `~/.kiro/crew/admission_policy.json`; this gate governs App Kit apps from a separate `config_dir()/app_admission.json`. The fleet-controlled policy carries a kill-switch (`banned`, always wins), a marketplace `approved` allowlist (non-empty = only-these), and an optional HMAC `require_signature` check (verified against a `trust_keys` secret the *policy* — never the app — holds, over `AppManifest.signing_payload()`). `app_admission_denied()` runs **before** the app's files are copied or its `onInstall` script runs, so a denied app never lands on disk or executes. **Fail-closed** on a present-but-unreadable policy (deny-all + `critical` SEL audit); an **absent** policy admits (interim default preserving today's no-policy behavior — the seeded-default mechanism that makes absence itself fail-closed belongs to the CPP governance seam). Asymmetric signing + trusted-publisher-key distribution + a per-app capability ceiling remain follow-on.

**Federated registry validation & refresh (`apps/routes.py`, `apps/registry.py`)**: external (federated) app registries are configured under `config.registries` (`{name, repo, branch}`) and mutated via the dashboard API. The trust-boundary contract:
- **`repo` validation** — `POST /api/apps/registries` runs every entry's `repo` through `_is_safe_repo_identifier`, which admits **either** a legacy bare name (`^[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$`, kept for companion resolution) **or** a vetted full git URL. URLs must be `https://` (`_SAFE_HTTPS_URL_RE` — plaintext `http://` is rejected, see the CWE-319 threat row) or an explicit `ssh://` remote (`_SAFE_SSH_URL_RE`, userinfo optional — both `ssh://host/path` and `ssh://user@host/path` accepted; authentication is by key via ssh config) or scp-style (`_SAFE_SCP_URL_RE`, `user@` required because a userless scp form is ambiguous with local paths); shell metacharacters, `..` traversal, and `owner/repo` shorthand are rejected. When no explicit `name` is supplied, a bare name defaults to `repo` (legacy) while a URL derives a collision-safe slug via `_derive_registry_name` (host+path slug + short sha256 of the original URL) so two distinct URLs can never share an `_external_registry_cache_path` cache file. `branch` defaults to **`main`** (was `mainline`) and is validated against `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_\-./]*$` with `..` rejected.
- **Cache-key injectivity (path traversal, CWE-22/CWE-706)** — because a `repo`/registry `name` can now be a full URL, every cache path derivation (`_safe_cache_stem`, `_external_registry_cache_path`, `_blob_cache_key`) keeps pure-safe names byte-identical (existing caches stay valid) but slugifies + appends a short sha256 of the **original** name for any name carrying disallowed characters — so a hostile `../../config` entry can neither escape `_manifest_cache_dir()` nor collide with another name. `_expire_cache_file` additionally re-checks resolved containment before touching any file.
- **Refresh endpoint — `POST /api/apps/registries/refresh`** (optional body `{"repo": "<git-url-or-name>"}` to scope to one registry; omit to refresh all). Response contract: `{ok, refreshed, failed, results, apps, lastSyncedAt}` where `ok` is True only if every matched registry refetched successfully, and `results` carries per-registry outcome so the UI distinguishes "synced" from "sync failed, serving stale". The refetch is **fetch-then-swap**: `_fetch_and_cache_external_registry` overwrites a registry's cache only on a successful fetch, and manifest caches are expired by mtime-backdating rather than unlink, so a transient forge/network failure degrades to "slightly stale" instead of "apps vanished" (stale > missing). Malformed (non-dict) index items are defensively dropped before normalization so a registry returning e.g. `["oops"]` cannot escape as an HTTP 500.
- **Clone-host trust gate (SSRF + DNS-rebinding, CWE-918)** — a configured external registry's `app-registry.json` is **untrusted content**: it can list an app whose `repo` points at an internal address (e.g. `https://127.0.0.1:8443/x`) or any attacker-chosen host, and such a value passes `_is_safe_repo_identifier` and enters the blob-proxy allowlist. Because the App Store browse/refresh path clones automatically (icons, manifests, install), honoring that host would drive `git clone` against the loopback/internal network — an authenticated backend SSRF. `is_clone_host_trusted` (`apps/registry.py`) fails **closed** and constrains every URL clone to a **host** in the trust set = well-known public forges (`_PUBLIC_GIT_HOSTS`, plus any a companion contributes) **∪** the hosts of the owner's explicitly-configured registries (`_configured_registry_hosts`). It is enforced at the **three** clone chokepoints: `_fetch_git_blob` (blob/icon proxy, `apps/routes.py`), `_fetch_app_manifest` (manifest fetch, `apps/registry.py`), and `_git_clone_or_pull` (the actual clone/pull, which returns the `untrusted_clone_host` error dict). Gating on the hostname — not its re-resolvable IP — makes it **rebinding-proof**; an owner-added internal forge stays allowed precisely because the owner added it, while an index-injected host never is. This is deliberately a **host-level SSRF/rebinding defense, not a supply-chain control** — anything on a trusted forge host (e.g. all of `github.com`) is cloneable, so signature/admission gating (the App Kit admission gate above) remains the second, orthogonal layer. Bare-name legacy repos have no URL host, return `False` here, and are served by the bundled-registry allowlist rather than a URL clone. Operator-visible failure mode: an install/browse against an untrusted host fails with `untrusted_clone_host` (clone path) or a silent skip + warning log (blob/manifest paths).
  - **Host-granular trust residual → credential-free clones (confused-deputy, CWE-441/CWE-668)** — the trust gate above is deliberately **host-granular**, so a host the owner configured for one registry (e.g. their internal forge) is trusted *wholesale*. Since a registry index is untrusted content, it can list an app whose `repo` points at a *sibling* private repo on that same trusted host; the host passes `is_clone_host_trusted`, and a clone that carried the gateway's **ambient git/ssh identity** would be a confused-deputy read of a private sibling repo surfaced back through the App Store. This applies on **two** paths: the **automatic** (browse/refresh-time) `_fetch_app_manifest` / `_fetch_git_blob` clones (no owner action at all), **and** the **install** clone of an app whose registry entry came from an owner-configured *external* index (the owner clicked Install on an index-authored *name/description*, but the `repo` URL behind that button is index-controlled, not typed by the owner). Mitigation on **both** paths: the clone runs **credential-free / anonymous** via `anonymous_git_env()` (`apps/registry.py`) **plus** a forced `mode="strict"` OS sandbox (`~/.ssh` hidden). The env drops the SSH agent + `GIT_SSH`/`GIT_SSH_COMMAND` passthrough (`_GIT_CREDENTIAL_ENV_KEYS`), disables system **and** global git config (`GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1` + `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=os.devnull`, so no HTTPS credential helper fires), and forbids prompting (`GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, batch-mode `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` with no identity/agent) — so an index-injected private-sibling repo simply fails to clone (→ graceful fallback) instead of authenticating. **Provenance decides the install-path posture**: `install_from_registry` sets `index_originated = bool(entry.get("_registry"))` — external-index entries carry the `_registry` marker (stamped when the index is fetched/cached), so they clone credential-free; **bundled/curated** registry entries (no `_registry` marker) and fetching the owner's **own** configured registry index (`_fetch_external_registry_index`, whose URL the owner typed, not index-injected) remain owner-designated and keep full credentials via `minimal_env()`. `_git_clone_or_pull` takes an `index_originated` keyword that selects the env + sandbox mode for both its fresh-clone and fast-forward-pull branches. Accepted residual: installing (or previewing the icon/manifest of) a **private** app *listed in an external index* no longer works — the correct trade, since an index-controlled URL must not be cloned with the gateway's identity; the owner can still install a private app by configuring it as their own registry (an owner-typed URL). Trust remains host-granular by design; org/path-prefix scoping is a deferred tightening, but the credential-free rule removes the exfiltration lever it would otherwise carry.
    - **Same-repo credential carve-out** — exception to the credential-free rule above. When an index entry's **effective clone URL** (`_entry_git_url(entry)`) is **byte-identical** to the owner-configured `ExternalRegistryConfig.repo` (the URL the owner typed when adding the registry), the confused-deputy argument does not apply: the owner explicitly designated that exact URL, and a clone of it is no different from the credentialed index fetch the gateway already performs. `_is_owner_designated_repo` (`apps/registry.py`) implements this predicate — it looks up the configured registry by the entry's `_registry` name and compares with **exact string equality** (no URL normalization, no host-level matching; host-granular trust is precisely the confused-deputy hole this defense closes). When the predicate is True, `install_from_registry` flips `index_originated` to `False`, and `_fetch_app_manifest` receives `owner_designated=True` — both paths then use `minimal_env()` + `_context_clone_sandbox_mode` (i.e. `standard` for a trusted SSH host, exposing `~/.ssh`), flipping **both** env AND sandbox together (the strict sandbox hiding `~/.ssh` is the load-bearing enforcement on machines with on-disk SSH certificates such as mwinit, not the env alone — see the investigation appendix for the live refutation of env-only blocking). Sibling repos on the same host (a *different* URL from the config-stored one) remain anonymous+strict — the carve-out is URL-exact, not host-granular. The practical effect: private-forge registries using the monorepo `apps/*` layout (all apps inside the registry repo itself) become fully functional — manifest fetches and installs succeed with the owner's credentials. Pinned by `TestSameRepoCredentialCarveOut` in `test/test_external_registry.py`.
    - **Origin-mismatch move-aside + aged sweep (data-loss prevention)** — when `_git_clone_or_pull` detects an origin mismatch (`_clone_origin_matches` returns False), the stale checkout is **moved aside** (atomic same-filesystem rename to a `.stale-<uuid>` sibling inside `app-sources/`) before the fresh clone, NOT deleted. On clone **success**: the moved-aside directory is **retained** (not deleted) so the user can recover local edits; a log line names the retained path. Aged `.stale-*`/`.partial-*` directories are swept by `_sweep_stale_checkouts()` (best-effort, runs at the start of the next `install_from_registry` call) after `_STALE_CHECKOUT_RETENTION_DAYS` (7 days); the sweep targets only immediate children of `app-sources/` matching the fixed naming pattern, containment-checked via symlink resolution against the app-sources root. On clone **failure or timeout**: the moved-aside directory is **restored** to `dest` so the previous checkout survives — no local changes are permanently lost by a transient network/forge failure. If the move-aside rename itself fails (locked files on Windows), the function returns `stale_clone_not_removed` without attempting a clone — **fail-closed** preserved. The mismatched clone is never built from or pulled from under any branch of this flow. The moved-aside path stays inside the `app-sources/` root (uses `dest.with_name(...)`, never escapes the parent). Pinned by `TestOriginMismatchDeleteOrder` in `test/test_external_registry.py`.
- **Untrusted index entry-name filter (path traversal, CWE-22)** — an external registry index is untrusted input, so a hostile/typo entry `name` such as `/tmp/victim` or `../../victim` would otherwise flow through `list_registry → install_from_registry → app_source_dir(name)` (which resolves `_app_sources_dir() / name`, and an absolute or traversing name escapes the app-sources root) and, on a failed clone, reach `shutil.rmtree(dest)` on the attacker-selected path. During index normalization (`apps/registry.py`) every entry name is validated against `KEBAB_RE` (`^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$`, the same kebab-case gate `install`/`register_external_app` already enforce via `AppManifest`); a non-string or non-kebab name is **dropped BEFORE it is cached or listed** so it can never reach a filesystem operation. Operator-visible failure mode: the offending entry silently vanishes from the App Store and the drop is **warning-logged only** (`Dropping external registry <reg> entry with invalid name ...`) — no install error surfaces, so an operator diagnosing a "missing app" must consult the gateway log.
- **Untrusted index `subdirectory` filter (path traversal → RCE, CWE-22)** — an external index controls the entire entry, including `subdirectory`, which is joined to the throwaway manifest clone dir (`_fetch_app_manifest`), the persistent app-source dir, and the install-time app-root (`install_from_registry`). An absolute (`/etc`) or traversing (`../../victim`) value would escape those roots and let an attacker-selected `app.json` be read and its `setup.onInstall` executed with gateway privileges. Two layers close it: (1) a **lexical gate** `_is_safe_registry_subdir` (`apps/registry.py`) — rejects non-strings, NUL, backslashes, absolute paths (POSIX/drive-letter), and any `.`/`..` segment — applied during index normalization **and** on every cache read (`_read_external_registry_cache`), so an unsafe entry is **dropped BEFORE it is cached, listed, or installed** (warning-logged only, same silent-vanish failure mode as the name filter); and (2) `_contained_join(root, subdirectory)` at each use site, which resolves symlinks and returns the joined path only if it stays within `root` — catching a hostile clone that ships a symlink (`sub -> /etc`) resolving outside the clone root at read/install time (install refuses with an explicit `unsafe subdirectory ... escapes the app source root` error; manifest fetch returns `None`).
- **Trust-grant audit (`registries.host_trust_granted` SEL event + `newlyTrustedHosts`)** — admitting a new registry host is a genuine **trust grant** (its hosts feed the clone-trust set above and its apps become installable with gateway privileges), not a mere config edit, and the generic `registries.update` event does not record *which* host gained trust — leaving an unreconstructable, one-way-door audit gap. The `PUT /api/apps/registries` handler (`apps/routes.py`) diffs the incoming hosts against the **prior on-disk** config and emits a distinct per-host SEL `registries.host_trust_granted` (`resources=host=<h> repo=<url>`) for each genuinely new host; re-saving an unchanged list — or adding a second path on an already-trusted host — emits nothing, so the audit log records exactly the trust transitions. The response returns `newlyTrustedHosts` so a client can surface the grant (e.g. a UI heads-up) without another round-trip.

**Response security headers** (`server.py:_apply_security_headers`):
- All dashboard responses receive `Cache-Control: no-store`, `Content-Security-Policy` (default-src 'self' plus curated exceptions for tailwind/jsdelivr/esm.sh, `fonts.googleapis.com` in `style-src` + `fonts.gstatic.com` in `font-src` for the dashboard's two brand webfonts, and WebSocket loopback), and `Permissions-Policy: clipboard-write=(self), clipboard-read=(self)`
- The Permissions-Policy grant is required by Chrome 143+, which changed the default policy to DENY `clipboard-write` even on secure contexts (crbug.com/414348233). Without it, `navigator.clipboard.writeText` throws a permissions-policy violation and the Copy-link button on published artifacts fails
- `frame-src` always admits loopback preview origins — http+https on `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `[::1]`, `0.0.0.0` (`_LOOPBACK_FRAME_SRC`) — so the chat side-panel **Web Preview** tab (`WebPreviewPanel`) can frame a local dev/static server in the packaged app, not only when the instances feature is enabled. The framed preview cannot read the dashboard's host-scoped session cookie: `WebPreviewPanel.isolatePreviewHost` rewrites a preview whose host equals the dashboard's (both loopback, incl. `*.localhost`) to a distinct loopback alias, so no `mc_token_<port>` cookie is ever sent to the previewed server. When the instances feature is additionally enabled, `frame-src` is extended with the `http://*.localhost:*` tunnel wildcard so dynamically-connected tunnel ports can be framed
- Defense-in-depth framing/sniffing/referrer/transport headers are set uniformly (all via `setdefault`): CSP `frame-ancestors` (clickjacking) — `'self'` by default plus any **exact operator-trusted origins** (never a wildcard, never a hardcoded port); `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` as a legacy backstop set **only** in the default `'self'`-only posture (omitted when an extra ancestor is trusted, since it is origin-exact and cannot express the allowlist); `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` (MIME confusion), `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` (avoids leaking the token-bearing dashboard URL cross-origin), and `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` (inert over the loopback HTTP bind, protects HTTPS tunnel/desktop access). Cross-port embedding of remote dashboards in the Instances viewport is enabled **only** via exact trusted-origin embedding carried in the signed token: at connect the local (embedding) gateway mints the remote token with an `embed_parent_port` claim equal to its own `KIROCREW_PORT`; that claim is carried through the link→session token exchange into the `mc_token_<port>` session cookie (`token_auth_middleware` — the exchange re-mints a fresh session token and must propagate the claim), and the middleware also stashes the validated port on the request **before** it revokes the link nonce. The embedded remote's `_extra_frame_ancestors` reads it in that order — the request-stashed value first (so the FIRST `?token=` framed document, whose link nonce the exchange revokes, still carries the origin), then the query token, then the session cookie (`token_embed_parent_port`) — and adds the parent's loopback origins (all loopback hosts at that port) to `frame-ancestors`. Exact origins only — never a wildcard, never a hardcoded port — and gated on a signed token, so a local page with no token can never inject an ancestor. Neither a loopback-wildcard nor the CSRF `allowed_origins` set is used for framing: both would let a local origin (any port, or a CORS/`dashboard.url`/dev `localhost:3000` entry) frame the authenticated dashboard and receive the `SameSite=Lax` session cookie (clickjacking, per input-validation guidance). Any request without such a token keeps the default `frame-ancestors 'self'` + `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` posture
- Applied via `no_cache_middleware` using `setdefault` so per-handler overrides are preserved

**CSRF protection** (`server.py` + `origin.py`):
- Validates `Origin` (with `Referer` fallback) on POST/PUT/DELETE
- Allowed origins computed once via `build_allowed_origins()` at startup: `127.0.0.1:{port}`, `localhost:{port}`, `kirocrew.localhost:{port}`, plus configured host and machine hostname when not local-only, plus `localhost:3000` in dev mode
- Shared `check_origin()` function used by both CSRF middleware and WebSocket origin check — single source of truth

**Host-header validation (DNS-rebinding defense)** (`server.py` + `origin.py`):
- `host_validation_middleware` (`server.py`) rejects any request whose `Host` header does not name a host the dashboard serves. Both entrypoints (`start_dashboard` and the headless `start_api_server`) build it from the shared `_make_host_validation_middleware` factory — a single exemption point that cannot drift between the two chains. It is registered **second** in the middleware chain (right after `host_canonical_redirect`, before `no_cache_middleware`/`csrf_middleware`/token auth)
- Runs on **every** HTTP method (not just mutating ones): a GET-based data exfiltration is the rebinding payload, and it is **independent** of the CSRF Origin check and loopback trust — a rebound request is loopback at the socket but forges `Host`
- **Probe exemption (`origin.PROBE_PATHS`)**: `/api/health`, `/api/live`, `/api/ready` bypass the barrier — orchestrator probes (kubelet, Docker HEALTHCHECK, LBs) address the gateway by container/pod IP, which is never in the host allowlist. Compensating control: `_liveness_payload` gates the build-identity fields on `check_host` AND `is_direct_local_request`, so a rebound request learns only `{"ok": true}` — indistinguishable from a bare TCP connect succeeding. The exemption set is frozen and any addition to `PROBE_PATHS` is a security review; regression tests drive disallowed-Host probes through a real middleware chain (`test_api_health.py`)
- `check_host()` (`origin.py`) compares the `Host` header (port-stripped, lower-cased) against `build_allowed_hosts()` (`origin.py`), which derives the host allowlist from the SAME `allowed_origins` set the CSRF check uses (so the two layers never drift) plus the canonical loopback names as a floor. Comparison is **port-independent** (hostname only), so an SSH-tunnel local port still matches
- **Deny-by-default**: a missing/empty `allowed_origins` is treated as a denial (never fail-open); a missing/empty `Host` is allowed **only** from a loopback `request.remote` (local IPC clients like mcp-core/doctor that omit `Host`), positively confirmed rather than blanket-allowed
- Rejects unknown Hosts with `403 Host header not allowed` + a `log_api_access` SEL event (`outcome="denied"`)

**WebSocket origin validation** (`ws.py` + `origin.py`):
- `_check_ws_origin()` calls shared `check_origin(require=True)` before `ws.prepare()`
- Reads `app["allowed_origins"]` (same set as CSRF middleware)
- Rejects missing Origin (non-browser clients) and cross-origin requests
- **Same-origin loopback fallback**: when an `Origin` is not in the
  allowed set, it is still accepted if its host is loopback **and** it exactly
  equals the request `Host` header — a genuine same-origin request. This covers
  the multi-instance embedded iframe, which is served at `<host>:<tunnelPort>`
  and opens its WebSocket to that same `location.host` (so `Origin == Host`),
  without reopening SEC-016: an arbitrary-port local page's `Origin` differs
  from the gateway `Host`, and browsers forbid scripts from forging either
  header. Non-loopback `Origin == Host` is **not** auto-trusted (still allowlist-only).

### Slack Owner Authorization

**Deny-by-default owner lock**:
- `_init_socket_mode()` refuses to connect if `KIROCREW_OWNER_ID` is unset/empty
- `_on_event()` rejects all messages when owner ID is missing (secondary guard)

**Interactive button verification** (5 defense-in-depth layers):
1. Owner check in `_handle_interactive()` — deny-by-default (rejects unless positively confirmed)
2. Owner check in `handle_interaction()` — handler defense-in-depth
3. `conversations.info` DM gate for Trust/YOLO actions
4. Trust/YOLO buttons suppressed in group channels
5. `disable_yolo()` + `yolo off` keyword to reverse YOLO

Non-owners receive ephemeral message: "⛔ Only the KiroCrew owner can use these buttons."

**Safety override (YOLO) — time-limited with re-authorization** (`safety_override.py`):

Permanent YOLO mode has been eliminated. All activations go through the `SafetyOverride` singleton which enforces a hard ceiling of 24 hours. The tiered TTL defaults are:

| Source | Default TTL | Max TTL |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Slack (`!yolo on`) | 30 minutes | 24 hours |
| Dashboard YOLO button | 6 hours | 24 hours |
| Config `approval_mode: "auto"` | 24 hours | 24 hours |

After expiry, re-authorization is required. A 5-minute grace window allows `!yolo renew` (Slack) or the dashboard re-auth button to extend the session without creating a new one. Outside the grace window, a fresh activation is needed.

SEL audit events are emitted on every lifecycle transition:
- `safety_override:activate` — override enabled
- `safety_override:renew` — session extended within grace window
- `safety_override:expired` — TTL reached, auto-deactivated
- `safety_override:deactivate` — manually disabled

Fleet governance endpoints:
- `/api/status` now reports `yolo_active` (bool) and `yolo_expires_at` (ISO 8601) fields
- `/api/admin/compliance/yolo-status` provides full override status (source, remaining time, activation count, renewal history)

Expiry notifications are delivered via Dashboard WebSocket and Slack DM to inform the user before and at override expiration. The Slack expiry DM flows through a shared redacting `_dm_owner` exit point (`dashboard/server.py`): text passes `redact_exfiltration_urls()` then `redact_credentials()` before `post_message`, so any future caller forwarding LLM/user-derived content cannot leak credentials or exfil URLs.

**Challenge-and-redirect for Slack direct requests** — **REMOVED**
(`slack/events.py`, `slack/allowlist.py`):

> The redirect flow intercepted every inbound Slack message and turned it into
> a presigned dashboard-session link (deny-by-default), an enterprise-internal-only
> posture. It has been removed for external/open-source usage: Slack messages
> are processed **inline** and reach the agent directly, gated by the user
> allowlist and the Enterprise Grid origin check. `send_channel_challenge()`
> and the `_CHALLENGE_REDIRECT_ENABLED` gate no longer exist; do not restore
> them on an upstream sync.

**3-tier interactive trust escalation** (`dashboard/chat_runner.py`, `dashboard/chat_handlers.py`):

When the dashboard presents a tool approval prompt, users can now choose from three trust levels:

| Action | Scope | What it trusts |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| `trust_command` | Session-scoped | Exact command/tool (e.g., `ls /tmp`) |
| `trust_base` | Session-scoped | Base command glob (e.g., `ls *` — trusts `ls` with any arguments) |
| `yolo` | Global | All tools across all slots (existing behavior, now time-limited) |

Trust patterns are stored per-slot as session-scoped fnmatch globs (`slot._trusted_patterns`). Pattern matching uses the ACTUAL command from `tool_input` (not the LLM-controlled display text) for security. For non-shell MCP tools without `tool_input`, `event.title` is used as it IS the provider-controlled tool name. Multi-command titles (e.g., `cat,wc`) generate patterns for each binary.

### SEL Audit Logging (`sel.py`)

See `docs/system-specs/modules/sel.md` for full spec. Every event carries a `source` stamped by `_infer_source`; that function's return vocabulary IS the set of audited surfaces and is published via `sel.audit_sources()` (consumed by the security-posture view, so the count is derived rather than restated here).

**What counts as an auditable permission decision.** A SEL event is emitted when a decision has a *subject* — a tool/capability that was granted or denied. The audit records grants and denies, not the absence of any decision:

- **Skill triggering** (`skills.py:get_triggered_skills`, runs per message) emits **one** event per call when at least one skill was injected (`outcome="triggered"`, grant) or actively excluded by a negative trigger that would otherwise have matched (`outcome="denied"`, with the excluded skills in `metadata.negated`). When no skill matched and none was negated — the overwhelmingly common case — **no event is emitted**: nothing was granted or injected into LLM context, so there is no permission decision with a subject to record (analogous to not auditing an authz check that had nothing to authorize). This is a deliberate, threat-model-reviewed choice: the prior per-skill "not_triggered" logging was a per-message synchronous-write hot-path cost, and a per-message "matched nothing" event would dwarf the real grant/deny signals and *reduce* the audit trail's usefulness rather than improve it. The message text is already captured in conversation history; skill names are not secret.

### Security Posture Detail Registry (`security_posture.py`)

The Settings → Security "Live Security Posture" card renders from
`GET /api/security/posture`, whose payload is built by
`security_posture.build_posture_snapshot()`. It exists to fix a class of bug, not
just to add a view: the panel previously rendered **hardcoded counts** that had
silently drifted several-fold from reality — every one of `13` sensitive paths,
`42` suspicious patterns, `5` redaction paths, and `12` tool schemas was wrong —
and a reader had no way to see what any count covered.

**Do not write the current values into this doc.** Restating them here is how the
original bug propagated (the dashboard's hardcoded `5` was transcribed from a doc
sentence), and a literal added here goes stale the moment a control grows — as one
did while this very section was being written. Read the live counts from
`GET /api/security/posture`, or from `security_posture.posture_counts()`.

**Derivation invariant.** Every control's `count` is `len(items)` — the pill and the
expanded list can never disagree — and `items` are produced by an `items_fn`
callable resolved **per request** against the live control.
`api_security_stats` re-sources its counts from this registry, so there is exactly
one place a count is computed. Controls split into two classes:

- **Derived (7):** items come straight from the enforcing object —
  `security.sensitive_home_dirs()`, `write_protected_home_paths()`,
  `BUILTIN_DENIED_RULES`, `SUSPICIOUS_BASH_PATTERNS`, the MCP dispatch registries
  (`MCP_CORE_SCHEMAS` / `MCP_CRON_SCHEMAS`, **not** the `*_SCHEMA` naming
  convention — several registered tools are inline/shared schemas with no
  module-level name), `exfil_query_min_len()`, and `sel.audit_sources()`. For these
  drift is structurally impossible.
- **Curated (3):** `_REDACTION_SINKS`, `_CREDENTIAL_FAMILIES`, `_EXFIL_HEURISTICS`
  have no single live list to enumerate (a sink is a *call site*, a family is a
  *regex alternative*, a heuristic is a *branch*). A `len()` of a hand-written
  tuple would merely relocate the original stale-number bug into this module, so
  each is paired with an **omission-detecting** test in
  `test_security_posture.TestOmissionDetection`:
  - the redaction registry is checked against **every** redactor call site in the
    package — each module must be a registered sink or an explicitly-reasoned
    entry in `NON_EGRESS_REDACTION_MODULES` (with a companion test rejecting stale
    allowlist entries), so a new output path cannot be added without classifying it.
    The detector regex must stay broad enough to see **every wrapper**
    (`redact_and_truncate`, `redact_via_context`, qualified `security.redact(...)`,
    `StreamRedactor`), because a form missing from it is the same omission hole one
    level up — a narrow earlier version silently skipped the `redact_and_truncate`
    Slack egress in `dashboard/chat_slack.py` and `slack/blocks.py`. Prefer
    over-matching: an extra module is classified once, whereas a missed one is
    invisible forever;
  - each advertised credential family must have a synthetic sample that
    `redact_credentials()` actually fires on, and the family list and sample table
    must match exactly (so a new regex alternative without a row fails);
  - each advertised exfil heuristic must have a URL that `scan_exfiltration_urls()`
    actually flags, with the same exact-match requirement.

  An omission is the failure mode that shipped "5 output paths" against several times that many.
  Only a test that detects an omission catches it; a `len()` assertion never will.

**Disclosure contract (posture-only, mirroring the governance viewer).** The
payload carries public control *definitions* and derived counts only:

- **Included**: blocked path patterns (the blocklist is already public in
  `docs/architecture/security-deep-dive.md`; knowing `~/.aws` is blocked does not help reach
  it), redaction-sink module names, credential **family** names, heuristic
  descriptions, audited surface names, deny-rule *descriptions*.
- **Excluded**: credential material, governance policy/profile **rule contents**
  (the ceiling the agent is fenced from — this endpoint must not become a side
  channel around the governance viewer's counts-only rule), user data, and the raw
  deny **regexes** (those keep their own opt-out surface in Card A's chevron).
- A pinned test asserts the entire JSON payload passes **both** redaction passes
  (`redact_credentials()` **and** `redact_exfiltration_urls()`, plus the dual-pass
  `redact()`) **unchanged** — so a description written with a live credential or
  long-query-URL shape in it (e.g. a literal bearer-header example) fails CI
  rather than shipping a row that renders as `[REDACTED: …]` wherever the payload
  is itself scanned (the SEL audit log, a Slack-relayed summary). A companion test
  proves the guard is non-vacuous.
- The governance boundary is pinned on **provenance, not key names**: a test
  asserts this module's source contains no reference to the governance machinery
  (`platform.governance`, `governance_profiles`, `resolve_active_scope`,
  `current_context`, `security_policy`/`admission_policy`). A name-only guard
  ("no control key contains `policy`") is trivially bypassed — a control keyed
  `ceiling_scopes` could republish literal policy deny globs and still pass it.
  If the module cannot *reach* governance, it cannot leak it under any key name.

**Honest per-sink coverage.** Most redaction sinks run both scanners; a few run
only one (`task_reporter.py` is exfil-URL-only; `sel.py`'s on-disk writer signs
bytes as-written, so its callers redact before `log`). Those rows say so in their
own detail text, and a test asserts a partially-covered sink cannot be described
without that disclosure. Likewise, the `suspicious_patterns` row states it is
**advisory** (surfaced by the `kirocrew` history scan via `audit_bash_command`),
not enforced at the PreToolUse gate — the gate uses the narrower
`audit_bash_exfiltration` plus the denied-command rules.

**`/api/security/stats` is retained but no longer used by the dashboard**, which
reads `/api/security/posture` (same counts plus the items). It re-sources via
`posture_counts_async`, which resolves every `items_fn` — so the count is still
`len(items)` — without materializing or serializing the ~45 KB item payload to
return three integers. A test pins the two paths to identical values so they
cannot become a second, divergent count source.

**Executor choice.** `build_posture_snapshot_async` / `posture_counts_async` offload to the dedicated
`governance_executor` (`mc-gov`), NOT the shared default pool — the same choice
`build_governance_policy_snapshot_async` makes, for the same reason: this GET is
browser-triggerable, so once a control does filesystem I/O (the case the
per-request `items_fn` design exists to keep safe) default-pool I/O would contend
with the workers the event loop shares for DNS.

**Failure isolation.** A control whose `items_fn` raises degrades to
`{"count": null, "unavailable": true, "items": []}` and the remaining controls
still render. The frontend shows an explicit `unavailable` badge — never `0`,
which would tell an operator that a live control covers nothing.

**Denied-commands count is the one runtime-variable pill.** The registry reports
the **shipped** built-in rule table (137); the panel overrides that row's pill with
the **effective** count from `GET /api/security/denied-commands` (after user
opt-outs and governance pins), because that is what is actually enforced.

**Public accessors.** `security.py` exposes `sensitive_home_dirs()`,
`write_protected_home_paths()`, `crew_home_prefixes()`, and
`exfil_query_min_len()` (returning tuples/ints, so a caller cannot mutate a live
blocklist) — the same decoupling rationale as `get_credential_patterns()`: a
future rename of the private name cannot silently turn the posture view into a
lie. `security_posture.py` is a leaf module; the two `token_auth` TTL constants are
imported function-locally to avoid the `kiro_crew.dashboard` package cycle.

### Frontend Security

- **No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with unsanitized content** — all HTML content sanitized via DOMPurify
- **Safe DOM APIs** — `createElement` + `textContent` for error fallbacks (not `innerHTML`)
- **Ref callbacks** for highlight.js output (DOMPurify-sanitized)
- **React text children** instead of `esc()` + `sanitize()` HTML strings
- **No regex URL linkification in HTML strings** — use React elements via `.split()`
- **Shell injection prevention** — `/etc/hosts` update uses `sudo tee -a` (not `sh -c echo`)

## Security Rules for Development

When writing new code, these rules MUST be followed:

### Backend
1. **Never read sensitive paths** — all file reads must go through `hooks.py` which enforces `is_sensitive_path()` and `is_sensitive_bash_command()`
2. **Never trust LLM output** — scan with `redact_exfiltration_urls()` before posting to any external surface (Slack, dashboard, API responses)
3. **Validate all MCP tool inputs** — use `validation.py` schemas; never pass raw LLM input to filesystem, subprocess, or database operations
4. **Deny-by-default for authorization** — reject unless positively confirmed. Never use `if x and y and z` guards where any falsy value skips the check
5. **Sandbox all agent subprocesses** — new subprocess spawning must go through `AcpClient._spawn()` which applies OS-level sandbox
6. **Enforce denied commands** — new destructive CLI-facing tools must be covered by a `DeniedCommandRule` in `BUILTIN_DENIED_RULES` (`security.py`); enforcement is at the hooks PreToolUse gate, never via kiro agent-config injection
7. **Log security events** — all tool invocations and permission *decisions* (a capability granted or denied) must emit SEL events. The absence of a decision — e.g. skill-trigger matching that injected and excluded nothing — is not itself an auditable event (see "What counts as an auditable permission decision" above)

### Frontend
1. **Never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`** without DOMPurify sanitization
2. **Never use `innerHTML`** — use `textContent`, `createElement`, or React elements
3. **Never construct HTML strings with user/LLM content** — use React components
4. **Sanitize all external content** — use `md()`, `sanitize()`, or `esc()` from `helpers.ts`
5. **No inline event handlers in HTML strings** — use React event props

### Binary File Handling (`security.py`, `handlers/files.py`, `mcp_core.py`)

The `file_send` MCP tool and outbox handlers support binary media files with a deny-by-default MIME allowlist.

#### BINARY_MIME_ALLOWLIST

Module-level constant in `security.py`. Only these MIME types are accepted for binary (non-UTF-8) files:

| Category | Types |
|----------|-------|
| Audio | `audio/mpeg`, `audio/wav`, `audio/x-wav`, `audio/ogg`, `audio/flac`, `audio/aac`, `audio/mp4`, `audio/webm`, `audio/opus` |
| Video | `video/mp4`, `video/webm`, `video/ogg` |
| Image | `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/gif`, `image/webp`, `image/bmp` |
| Document | `application/pdf` |

**Excluded:** `image/svg+xml` (XSS vector — SVG can contain `<script>` tags).

#### Security Model

| File type | Content scan | MIME check | Disposition |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Text (UTF-8 decodable) | `redact()` for credentials/exfiltration | N/A | `attachment` |
| Binary (in allowlist) | Skipped (can't redact binary) | Must be in `BINARY_MIME_ALLOWLIST` | `inline` (browser renders natively) |
| Binary (not in allowlist) | N/A | Rejected with 400/403 | N/A |
| SVG (UTF-8 decodable) | `redact()` for credentials/exfiltration | Not in allowlist (text path) | `attachment` (never inline — defense-in-depth against XSS) |

#### Response Headers

All outbox downloads include:
- `Content-Type`: from `mimetypes.guess_type()` or `application/octet-stream`
- `Content-Disposition`: `inline` for media, `attachment` for others
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`: prevents MIME sniffing attacks

#### Invariants

- Path traversal protection unchanged (resolved path must be under `outbox_dir()`)
- Filename sensitivity check unchanged (`redact(filename) == filename`)
- Text content redaction unchanged for UTF-8 files
- Binary files: filename validated, content scan skipped (binary data cannot be meaningfully redacted)
- Dashboard multipart uploads open their destination with `O_BINARY` when the
  host provides it, so Windows cannot translate embedded LF bytes to CRLF and
  corrupt archives or media between validation and the restricted write.

#### Slack Delivery Audience — Strict Caller-Identity Classification (`file_send`)

`file_send` may additionally upload the file to Slack. The Slack **audience**
(which thread, or the whole channel) is decided from the CALLER's own session
identity, resolved **strictly** — gateway-injected `KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY` env
var or an HMAC-sidecar-verified host-pid only; **no** `/proc` ancestor walk and
**no** `session_pid_*.txt` filesystem glob. This closes both the
forged-`session_pid_*.txt` path and the subagent→parent misresolution path
(`_resolve_session_key_strict()` in `mcp_core.py`).

The identity is classified into **three** states by
`_classify_slack_identity() -> (state, thread_ts|None)`. Collapsing the two
non-thread cases into a bare `None` was a channel-root disclosure hazard: an
**unresolved** caller that still supplied an explicit tracked channel would
upload at the **channel ROOT** (`thread_ts=None` + channel), exposing a file
meant for one thread to the entire channel — fail-**OPEN** with respect to
audience. The states:

| State | Meaning | `file_send` disposition |
|-------|---------|-------------------------|
| `thread` | Resolved Slack thread — a canonical `slack:<thread_ts>` key (converted via `messaging.link.legacy_key`) or an already-bare legacy Slack key | Upload **threaded** to that `thread_ts` |
| `non_slack` | Resolved non-Slack session (`dashboard:`/`discord:`/app/channel/future namespace) — identity is KNOWN | Keep existing **authorized** routing (owner DM / session-map-linked thread / explicit tracked channel); none of these broadcast at a channel root for an unknown caller |
| `unresolved` | Strict resolution failed (no gateway env var and no HMAC-verified host-pid) — caller cannot be attributed | **Refuse the Slack upload entirely** (fail CLOSED for audience). The file is still delivered via the dashboard/outbox card |

On the `unresolved` refusal, `file_send` records a SEL
`log_tool_invocation(outcome="denied", downstream_service="slack",
error="slack_identity_unresolved_upload_refused")` event and returns a warning
noting the Slack upload was skipped (dashboard delivery still succeeds).

**Warm-pool sessions:** a warm-pool-claimed Slack session has no strict identity
source (the gateway writes the env var / HMAC sidecar only at sandbox spawn, not
at warm-pool claim), so every one of its `file_send` calls classifies as
`unresolved` → the upload is **refused**, not broadcast. There is no interim
window that broadcasts at a channel root. Restoring proper *threaded* delivery
for warm-pool Slack sessions (by writing the HMAC sidecar at warm-pool claim
time) is a delivery-quality follow-up, not an audience-safety gate — the
disclosure hazard is closed by the refuse-on-unresolved rule above.
