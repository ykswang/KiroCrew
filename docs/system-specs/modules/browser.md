## Browser Module

Thin auth layer for enterprise-authenticated website browsing via Playwright MCP.

### Architecture

Browser Mode is a durable capability toggle in **Settings → Browser**. The gate is
**tool availability**, not a per-message marker: enabling it registers the browse
proxy so the `browser_*` MCP tools appear in the agent's tool list; disabling it
deregisters the proxy so the tools disappear. There is no `[BROWSE]` marker and no
per-message browse flag; the agent itself decides, per task, whether to operate a
browser or read with `web_fetch` (the system prompt and the web-browse / web-verify
skills tell it how).

```
Browser Mode ON  → proxy registered → browser_* tools present in the agent's
  tool list → agent operates the browser (browser_navigate, browser_click,
  browser_snapshot, …) when a task needs it, else uses web_fetch

Browser Mode OFF → proxy deregistered → no browser_* tools → agent reads with
  web_fetch / web_search
```

Registration IS the authorization: the tools exist iff Browser Mode is on.
`register_playwright_proxy()` refuses to write the proxy (returns `"mode-disabled"`)
while the flag is off, and the boot-time convergence removes any stale proxy when
the flag is off, so no setup/CLI path can mount the tools without the operator's
Settings-level consent. The durable `browser-mode-enabled` flag is a keystone the
agent cannot write (see [security](security.md)); the dashboard Settings API is its
sole writer.

### Two Modes

Two independent choices in **Settings → Browser** decide how a page opens: the
transport (attach to your own browser vs. let Playwright launch its own) and, for
the launch path, which engine Playwright launches.

| Mode | Platform | How it works |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Extension (attach)** | macOS (recommended) | Playwright attaches to the user's running **Chromium-family** browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc, Opera) through Microsoft's "Playwright Extension" (one Chrome Web Store listing covers the family; the connection token is optional and only skips the per-connection approval prompt). All existing auth (enterprise SSO session, Sentry, Kerberos) works automatically. Chromium-family only: Playwright ships no attach extension for Firefox or Safari, so those cannot be attached. |
| **Launch (headless)** | Linux Cloud Desktops, macOS fallback | Playwright launches its **own** browser build. The launch engine is one of `chromium` / `firefox` / `webkit` (default `chromium`), selected in Settings and persisted in the `browser-engine` file. `firefox` and `webkit` are Playwright's own patched builds, not the user's installed Firefox/Safari, so they carry no user logins. Chromium adds `--auth-server-allowlist` + storage-state cookie injection. |

### Key Design Decisions

**Delegate browsing to Playwright MCP** — we don't implement click/fill/navigate/screenshot.
Playwright MCP handles all browser interaction. KiroCrew only handles enterprise-SSO auth.

**Two auth strategies:**
- Extension mode: zero auth work — real Chrome session has everything
- Headless mode: storage state (`~/.kiro/crew/playwright-storage-state.json`) + Kerberos via `--auth-server-allowlist`

**Provision on Browser-Mode enable.** Turning Browser Mode on from Settings runs
`ensure_playwright_installed(engine)` in `browser/setup.py`, which bootstraps Node
when absent (through the bundled `ensure-node.sh`) and then makes `@playwright/mcp`
launchable the SAME way the proxy runs it and the whole MCP ecosystem installs it
— **via `npx`, never `npm install -g`**:

- **Detect first.** If a launcher already resolves (a standalone
  `mcp-server-playwright`/`playwright-mcp` binary, `npx`, or a
  `KIROCREW_PLAYWRIGHT_CMD` override), there is nothing to fetch — a re-enable, or
  a host that already has `npx`, downloads nothing.
- **npx-only host:** prime the `npx` cache with one pinned fetch so the first
  browse is not cold, then `playwright install <engine>` through the bundled
  `playwright-core` (revision-matched with the launcher). If the browser can't be
  provisioned yet it fails **soft** (`step: "browser-deferred"`, `ok: true`):
  `@playwright/mcp` downloads it on first use.
- **npm-free host** (Node without `npm`/`npx`): fails **soft** at `step:
  "package"` with the two npm-free paths — the official Docker image
  (`mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/mcp`) and the `KIROCREW_PLAYWRIGHT_CMD` override.

**Node resolution for desktop launches.** A packaged desktop gateway inherits
its environment from Launch Services, not an interactive shell, so exports in
`~/.zshrc` are absent. Node tools resolve in this order:

1. `KIROCREW_NODE_BIN_DIR`, then the `<data-home>/node-bin-dir` marker written by
   `ensure-node.sh` or an operator outside the application;
2. supported version-manager layouts (mise, asdf, nvm, fnm, Volta, and n), then
   the inherited `PATH`.

Browser Mode does not automatically execute Node from macOS package-manager
fallback directories such as `/opt/homebrew/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`; the
resolver uses explicit operator state and existing version-manager layouts
instead of accumulating package-manager-specific guesses. A Finder/Dock launch
that cannot see Homebrew Node must use an operator-written marker or a
process-manager environment override. Setup probes candidates in precedence
order and selects the first Node `>=18`, matching the declared runtime
requirement of `@playwright/mcp`, so an older marker or inherited Node does not
hide a supported candidate later in the search. Setup then promotes that exact
Node's bin directory ahead of every stale candidate, resolves `npx` only from
that directory, and invokes `playwright-core` with the selected Node executable.
The runtime proxy is a separate process, so it repeats the supported-version
probe at startup without invoking the installer, applies the same PATH ordering,
and uses the selected Node directly for JavaScript launchers. If no supported
Node is present, it fails immediately with a Settings > Browser setup hint. The
stricter frontend-build range remains owned by `ensure-node.sh`.

`node-bin-dir` is an executable trust root: Browser Mode later runs its
`node`/`npm`/`npx` in the unsandboxed gateway. The marker is therefore on the
read/write sensitive-path floor. Trusted setup code and an operator writing the
file outside the agent tool path do not traverse that gate. Automatic
version-manager layouts remain a same-UID trust surface shared with the build
toolchain, so omitting package-manager guesses is a discovery-scope choice rather
than a complete same-UID security boundary. Strict deployments should provide an
operator-selected, separately protected Node directory.

Resolver discovery remains cached for the gateway process lifetime. An operator
who changes `node-bin-dir` or `KIROCREW_NODE_BIN_DIR` must restart Kiro Crew; a
Settings retry does not make a newly written executable eligible. The trusted
bootstrap path clears the cache only after `ensure-node.sh` completes so the Node
installation it created is available immediately.

**Public-registry pin.** Every npm/npx fetch Kiro Crew triggers — the prime, the
browser install, and the proxy's own runtime `npx` launch — pins the public
registry via `npm_config_registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/` in the child env.
`@playwright/mcp` is a public package, but a user's ambient `.npmrc` may point the
default registry at a private mirror (corporate proxy, AWS CodeArtifact) whose
token expires; without the pin a bare fetch 401s. The pin is env-var based (not an
argv flag) so npm and npx honor it identically on macOS, Linux, and Windows. A
network whose only egress is that private mirror can set `KIROCREW_PLAYWRIGHT_CMD`
to bypass the fetch entirely.

**Version pin (npx hosts).** The enable-time prime records the exact
`@playwright/mcp` version it resolved to the `playwright-mcp-version` flag, and the
runtime proxy launches `@playwright/mcp@<that version>` instead of the floating
`@latest`. This makes an offline launch deterministic (resolves from the warm npx
cache, no registry round-trip) and stops `latest` from advancing past the browser
revision provisioned at enable time (the "Executable doesn't exist" drift). The
flag is validated against a strict semver pattern on read, so a tampered value
degrades to `@latest` rather than reaching an npx argv; absent, it also falls back
to `@latest`. Setup and the proxy both validate Node before deriving their launch
PATH with `node_augmented_path(preferred_node=...)`; a marker-bootstrapped
toolchain the gateway did not inherit is therefore found without letting an
unsupported earlier toolchain execute the launcher.

To install the revision-matched browser, setup resolves
`playwright-core/package.json` through Node and joins its sibling `cli.js`.
`playwright-core` does not export the `playwright-core/cli.js` package subpath,
so resolving that subpath directly is invalid even though the file is bundled
inside `@playwright/mcp`.

**Provisioning is always advisory — enabling never surfaces a raw error.** Turning
Browser Mode on registers the proxy (the capability is on) BEFORE and independent
of any download, and no provisioning outcome is ever shown to the operator as a raw
npm/playwright failure — the raw stderr is logged for debugging, never surfaced.
The outcome is honest about usability without ever being alarming:

- **`ok: true, step: "done"`** — browser provisioned.
- **`ok: true, step: "browser-deferred"`** — the launcher resolves but the browser
  was NOT yet attempted (npx cache still warming); a re-save once warm completes it.
- **`ok: false, step: "browser"`** — the browser download WAS attempted and failed
  (offline, unwritable/full cache). Honestly not-yet-usable (a headless browse needs
  the executable), so NOT reported as usable — but still a calm "toggle off/on to
  retry" note, never a stderr dump.
- **`ok: false, step: "node" | "package"`** — no supported Node, or no npm/npx
  launcher; calm "Browser Mode is on; to finish setup…" note. The Node outcome
  includes a shell-native `manual_command` that writes the terminal's Node bin
  directory to the marker and requires a full app restart. On Windows the detail
  names PowerShell explicitly. The process-level `KIROCREW_NODE_BIN_DIR`
  alternative remains in the install and configuration docs instead of the
  compact Settings advisory. The package outcome names Docker and
  `KIROCREW_PLAYWRIGHT_CMD`.

The dashboard renders every one of these as a MUTED advisory (info icon), never a
red error. `ensure_playwright_installed` is best-effort and never raises; the save
handler also wraps the call so an unexpected exception still returns 200 with a
deferred note rather than 500-ing. It returns a structured `{ok, step, detail, engine}`.
The dashboard state retains the latest structured result for the gateway process,
and `GET /api/browser/config` includes it while Browser Mode is enabled and the
selected engine still matches. Leaving and returning to Settings therefore replays
the same step-specific guidance instead of replacing a restart-required Node
outcome with a generic toggle retry. A full app restart clears both this transient
result and the cached Node-directory discovery.

**Browser Mode is a persistent capability toggle.** The durable
`browser-mode-enabled` flag file under the data home is the gate. While it is on,
the browse proxy is registered and the `browser_*` tools are in the agent's tool
list; while it is off they are removed and the agent uses `web_fetch` instead.

### Auth Flow (Headless Mode)

1. `kirocrew browse auth health` — validates SSO cookie, Kerberos ticket, AEA posture
2. `kirocrew browse auth refresh` — converts `~/.kiro/crew/browser-cookies.txt` → `~/.kiro/crew/playwright-storage-state.json`
3. Playwright loads cookies from storage state at context creation (no manual injection)
4. `--auth-server-allowlist=*.example.com` handles SPNEGO challenges (the OSS build ships no enterprise allowlist)
5. For SSO-gated sites: `kirocrew browse auth federate <url>` completes the federated login SPNEGO chain via curl

### Auth Flow (Extension Mode)

1. User has Chrome open with existing auth (enterprise SSO session, Sentry extension)
2. Playwright MCP connects via extension token (`PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_EXTENSION_TOKEN`)
3. All navigation uses the real authenticated session — no cookie injection needed

### Context Window Optimization (Playwright Proxy)

Playwright MCP's `browser_snapshot` returns full accessibility trees (50-100K tokens on heavy pages). The **Playwright proxy** (`kirocrew mcp-playwright-proxy`) intercepts these responses and auto-compresses them before they reach the LLM — the full tree never enters context.

**How it works:**
- kiro-cli → `kirocrew mcp-playwright-proxy` (stdio) → real `npm-playwright-mcp` (subprocess)
- Proxy forwards all messages bidirectionally
- Intercepts responses with accessibility trees (>5K chars with tree-like structure)
- Compresses to compact outline: only interactive elements (links, buttons, inputs, headings, images) with refs
- ~95% token reduction on heavy pages

**Registration (one canonical server, no duplicates):** kiro-cli splits an agent
`@server` reference on `/`, so a slash-containing key like `@playwright/mcp` is
mis-parsed as `@server/tool` and exposes none of the server's tools. The proxy is
therefore always registered under the **slash-free canonical alias**
`playwright-mcp` (`mcp_server_alias("@playwright/mcp")`), and every writer drops
the superseded keys it historically used so exactly one Playwright entry survives:

- `kirocrew setup` — new installs get the canonical proxy entry from the start.
- `patch_mcp_extension()` / `patch_mcp_headless()` — write the entry under the
  canonical alias, after `_drop_superseded_playwright()` removes any legacy proxy
  key (`@playwright/mcp`, `playwright-proxy-mcp`) **and** KiroCrew's legacy
  *direct* `npm:@playwright/mcp` entry (that `npm:`-prefixed key is a KiroCrew
  install artifact; a user's own direct server under the bare `@playwright/mcp`
  key is left untouched — authorship is by launch target, not key name).
- Gateway startup — `_migrate_playwright_to_proxy()` delegates to
  `migrate_owned_playwright_registration()`, which converges KiroCrew's own
  browse entry in `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` to the canonical key — including
  upgrading a legacy *direct* `npm:@playwright/mcp` entry (from installs predating
  the compression proxy) to the proxy — converges KiroCrew's own
  `~/.kiro/crew/mcp.json` at the SOURCE (so a stale proxy key there is healed once,
  not re-injected into every rebuild), and sweeps the KiroCrew-generated agent
  configs (the exact `kirocrew*` filenames it writes, not a bare `*.json` glob, so
  a user's own agents are never rewritten) so a duplicate proxy entry collapses
  onto the one canonical server. This self-heals an existing machine on a plain
  restart.
- Every agent-config rebuild — `converge_playwright_servers()` runs right after
  key normalization in `build_agent_config` as a BACKSTOP (the owned source files
  are healed at boot above; this catches anything re-merged mid-rebuild),
  collapsing any Playwright-proxy entry by *resolved launch target* (an entry that
  invokes `mcp-playwright-proxy`). This catches a slash-free legacy key (e.g.
  `playwright-proxy-mcp`) that key normalization — which only rewrites
  slash-containing keys — cannot fold. Convergence keeps the canonical key
  (unless a user's own *direct*, non-proxy server already occupies it — then the
  proxy is left under its own non-conflicting key rather than clobbering the user
  entry), rewrites dropped `@refs` in `tools`/`allowedTools`, and never touches a
  user-declared, non-proxy server. Together with discovery read-folding and pool
  launch-target dedupe, all surfaces agree on the single `playwright-mcp` server,
  so no second backend, dashboard row, or probe is derived.

**Ownership signals (authorship of an MCP entry).** `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` is
co-owned with kiro-cli, and kiro-cli validates it (and agent specs) with
`deny_unknown_fields`, so an in-spec ownership sentinel is impossible. KiroCrew
therefore records the MCP keys it writes in an out-of-band sidecar manifest
`~/.kiro/crew/owned-mcp-keys.json` (`_record_owned_mcp_key`, mode 0600), written by
`patch_mcp_extension()` / `patch_mcp_headless()`. Drop/converge decisions consult
this manifest **first** (`_load_owned_mcp_keys`); the `mcp-playwright-proxy`
launch-target heuristic (`_spec_is_proxy`) and the `npm:@playwright/mcp` legacy-key
rule remain the fallback for entries written by installs that predate the
manifest. This stops the unmarked-entry population from growing so future
migrations rely less on forensic heuristics on a destructive, every-restart path.
*Follow-up:* extend the manifest to the agent-config writers and to all
drop/converge sites (currently the sidecar sweep still keys on the owned-filename
allowlist + launch target), and consider consolidating the per-surface
convergence passes behind one canonicalizing `mcp_utils` accessor.

### Live Browse Mirror

The dashboard mirrors the headless browse Chromium in near-real-time **without
opening any debug port on the browser**. The headless Chromium runs on the gateway
host; the only window onto it from a laptop is the dashboard (reachable over the
reverse SSH tunnel).

**Relay path.** The Playwright proxy already intercepts every
`browser_take_screenshot` response and re-encodes it to JPEG. It additionally
re-POSTs that already-captured frame to the gateway's loopback
`POST /api/browser/frame`, which rebroadcasts it over the existing WS as a
`browser_frame` event; the `BrowserLiveView` panel renders the latest frame. This
rides Playwright's existing authenticated, pipe-based control channel — it
deliberately does **not** add a `--remote-debugging-port`. An earlier revision
attached to a CDP debug port for smoother frames; that port was an unauthenticated,
full-control endpoint on an authenticated browser session (a net-new
local-process-takeover surface), so it was dropped.

**Frame validation (`build_frame_payload`).** A pure helper normalizes the POSTed
body into the `browser_frame` payload so the framing contract is unit-testable:
- `data` must match the base64 charset (`_B64_RE`) — this structurally excludes
  `:` (no `://` URL), whitespace, and `<`/`>` (no HTML/script), which is the right
  boundary control for browser-captured image bytes; no text redaction is applied.
- `format` must be in the `{jpeg, png, webp}` allowlist; `svg` is deliberately
  excluded because an SVG data URI can carry executable script (XSS safety).
- `session_key` is passed through only if it matches a bounded safe charset
  (`_SESSION_KEY_RE`, ≤128 chars) so the WS payload can't carry arbitrary text.

**Active pump.** Frames from agent screenshots alone are sparse, so the proxy runs
a background active pump that injects its own idle-gated `browser_take_screenshot`
into the Playwright subprocess to keep the mirror current between agent shots
(~1-3 fps). It is single-in-flight (with a timeout so a hung browser can't wedge
it), demuxes the proxy-namespaced response id (`__mc_pump_` prefix — never
forwarded to kiro or written to disk), and backs off when there are zero
subscribers (learned from the frame endpoint's response subscriber count). It is
disabled in extension mode (the user already sees their own Chrome) and gated on
recent real browse activity.

**Pump audit.** The proxy is a stdlib-only stdio subprocess and cannot reach
`sel.py`, so each pump injection is reported to loopback
`POST /api/browser/pump-audit` and the gateway emits the SEL
`browser_take_screenshot` tool-invocation audit event on the proxy's behalf,
keeping proxy-internal tool calls auditable.

**Panel.** The live mirror renders in the floating `BrowserLiveView` window — a
lifecycle-driven, resizable, persisted overlay that auto-opens in the corner on
the first frame of a browse session (minimize→chip, close→dismiss-this-session).
It consumes the frame stream via `useBrowserFrame` and is threaded with the
resolved session *title* (the raw `session_key` is only a client-side lookup key
against the dashboard's own slot store). It is read-only — no interactive
control channel.

> Note: the chat side panel's **"Web Preview"** tab (`WebPreviewPanel`, opened
> from the + menu) is a SEPARATE feature — a URL-addressable iframe that
> live-previews a local dev server the user is running (per-session URL), NOT
> this agent-browse screenshot mirror. It does not consume the `browser_frame`
> stream. The URL bar has back/forward (a URL-bar history stack — an iframe's
> own cross-origin page history isn't readable), an inline reload, an
> open-in-browser link inside the field, and an **expand** toggle: expand
> broadcasts `PREVIEW_FOCUS_EVENT`, on which App collapses the left nav and
> ChatPage hides the session list + maximizes the side panel (chat shrinks to its
> minimum). A **dimension selector** (Monitor icon = responsive desktop;

**Fallback tools** in kirocrew-core (for manual use if needed):

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `browse_outline` | Compress snapshot text → compact outline with refs |
| `browse_search` | Regex search snapshot text → matching lines only |

### Dashboard Integration

- **Settings → Browser** panel: turn Browser Mode on/off (the durable capability
  toggle), pick the launch engine (`chromium` / `firefox` / `webkit`), toggle
  extension (attach) mode, and paste the extension token. Enabling Browser Mode
  triggers the Playwright install and re-registers the proxy.
- **Backend** gates browsing by tool availability: enabling Browser Mode
  registers the proxy (so the `browser_*` tools appear), disabling deregisters it.
  No `[BROWSE]` marker and no per-message chat toggle; the agent decides when to
  operate a browser vs. read with `web_fetch`.
- **BrowserAuthPrompt** component: notification banner when an auth gate is detected
- **API endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/browser/config`: read `enabled`, `engine`, `engines`, `installed`,
    `extension_mode`, and `token` status
  - `PUT /api/browser/config`: save `enabled`, `engine`, `extension_mode`, and
    `token`. On a fresh enable this downloads `@playwright/mcp` + the engine
    browser off the event loop and re-registers the proxy; a failed install
    reports an actionable `code` in the body rather than 500-ing
  - `POST /api/browser-auth-retry` — retry auth (calls `ensure()`)
  - `POST /api/browser-event` — broadcast browser activity events via WebSocket
  - `POST /api/browser/frame` — ingest a browse screenshot, rebroadcast as `browser_frame` WS event, return live subscriber count (loopback-only, in `internal_paths`)
  - `POST /api/browser/pump-audit` — SEL audit for proxy active-pump screenshot injections (loopback-only, in `internal_paths`)

### Security

| Control | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| URL validation | `federated_login()` (stubbed enterprise SSO flow) restricts to `*.example.com` placeholders; the OSS build ships no enterprise allowlist |
| Token storage | Written with `os.open(..., 0o600)` — not world-readable |
| SEL audit | All browser API endpoints emit SEL audit events |
| `browser_evaluate` | NOT auto-approved — requires user confirmation (cookie exfiltration risk) |
| Storage state | Written with `0o600` permissions via `os.open` |

### Platform Matrix

Extension (attach) mode is Chromium-family only. The launch (headless) path lets
the operator pick the engine (`chromium` / `firefox` / `webkit`, default
`chromium`); `firefox` and `webkit` are Playwright's own builds, not the user's
installed Firefox or Safari.

| Platform | Mode | Auth | Browser |
|----------|------|------|---------|
| macOS | Extension (attach, recommended) | Real browser session | User's Chromium-family browser (Chrome/Edge/Brave/Arc/Opera) via extension |
| macOS | Launch (fallback) | Storage state + SPNEGO | Playwright's own `chromium`/`firefox`/`webkit` build |
| AL2/AL2023 x86_64 | Launch (headless) | Storage state + SPNEGO | Playwright's own `chromium`/`firefox`/`webkit` build |
| AL2/AL2023 NICE DCV | Extension (attach, opt-in) | Real browser session | User's Chromium-family browser via extension |
| AL2 aarch64 (glibc 2.26) | Fallback | N/A | read-only `web_fetch` only |

### Credential Lifetimes

| Credential | Lifetime | Refresh | MCP Restart? |
|---|---|---|---|
| SSO session cookie | ~20 hours | your SSO login + `kirocrew browse auth refresh` + `browser_set_storage_state` | No |
| Kerberos TGT | ~6 hours | your Kerberos login | Yes (read at Chromium launch) |
| Extension token | Permanent (until Chrome extension reinstalled) | Re-copy from extension popup | Yes |

### Proof-of-Possession Enforcement (Future)

Cookie replay will stop working when SSO proof-of-possession is enforced.
- **Extension mode:** unaffected — real Chrome has the AEA extension
- **Headless mode:** will break — fall back to `ReadInternalWebsites` or switch to extension mode
