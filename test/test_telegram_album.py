"""Telegram album (media group) coalescing — unit tests.

Telegram delivers an album as N separate ``message`` updates sharing one
``media_group_id``, with the caption on only one member. Without coalescing a
four-screenshot album becomes four turns, three of them a bare image with no
context. These tests pin the debounce that merges them into one.

Timing is driven by monkeypatching the module's window constants down to
near-zero rather than by sleeping real seconds, so the suite stays fast and
deterministic.
