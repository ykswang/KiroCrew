"""Tests for kiro_crew.browser.setup — Playwright MCP setup.

``is_playwright_installed`` probes whether a launcher resolves (the same
resolution the proxy uses) and ``ensure_playwright_installed`` performs a real,
best-effort install of the public ``@playwright/mcp`` package plus the selected
engine's browser binary, bootstrapping Node when absent. The generic Netscape
cookie parsing, Playwright config generation and storage-state refresh work
regardless. The enterprise-SSO cookie/storage-state flow remains OSS-neutralized.
