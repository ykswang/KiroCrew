"""Measure the disk a session costs, and reclaim it under user control.

A session is presented as ONE thing with ONE size, because that is what it is to
the person looking at it. Underneath, its bytes are split across two stores that
Kiro Crew and kiro-cli each own:

* ``<data home>/sessions/<stem>.jsonl`` plus its rotated
  ``sessions/archive/<stem>__<stamp>.jsonl`` segments — the transcript, read by
  dashboard history, search and memory consolidation.
* ``<kiro home>/sessions/cli/<sid>.json`` + ``<sid>.jsonl`` — kiro-cli's replay
  log, read to resume the session.

That split is an implementation detail and never surfaces in a report: callers get
one total and one session count.

The split does, however, dictate the deletion rule. **A session's halves are
always reclaimed together.** Removing only one leaves a broken session rather than
a freed one: drop the replay log and the transcript still lists a session that can
no longer resume; drop the transcript and a resumable session has no history or
search. Either way the user is left with something worse than both extremes.
:func:`_unit_paths` is therefore the single place that answers "what files is this
session made of", and every move, restore and delete goes through it.

Not every session has both halves, and that is normal rather than an error — a
subagent run leaves only a replay log, and a session whose mapping was pruned
leaves only a transcript. The rule is that whatever halves exist move together.

Reclaiming moves files into ``<data home>/trash/sessions/<batch>/`` rather than
unlinking them. On a default install both stores sit under ``~/.kiro``, so the
move is a same-filesystem :func:`os.rename`: instant regardless of size, and
instantly reversible. Space is **not** returned to the filesystem until the trash
is emptied; :attr:`StorageReport.trash_bytes` exists so callers can say so plainly
instead of reporting a reclaim that leaves ``df`` unchanged.

Every batch carries an append-only manifest recording each file's original
absolute path, so a restore puts files back where they came from instead of
inferring it from the layout. A batch can span six figures of sessions, so a
whole-document manifest rewritten per move would cost quadratic bytes; appending
also leaves a partial batch fully restorable after an interruption.

    home reading the machine-wide store cannot see the default instance's
    mappings, so a resumable conversation reads as retired and could be staged and
    then emptied out from under a gateway this process cannot see.

    Decided on RESOLVED paths, never on whether the environment variables are set,
    and by requiring the store to be CONTAINED in this instance's data home rather
    than by testing it against the default location. Both overrides are validated
    and silently fall back to the default when they name an unsafe target, so
    ``KIRO_HOME=/etc`` alongside an isolated ``KIROCREW_HOME`` leaves this process
    reading the shared store while an env-presence test would report it isolated —
    the exact hazard, reached through a rejected override. Containment also covers
    a store that is shared without being the default one: two isolated instances
    pointed at the same custom ``KIRO_HOME`` see neither the default store nor each
    other's maps.

    The freshness floor narrows the window but does not close it — a session idle
    for a day is still resumable — so the operation is refused rather than
