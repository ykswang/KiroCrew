"""Slack Socket Mode gateway orchestrator for KiroCrew.

Manages the lifecycle of all runtime services: session manager, cron
scheduler, context builder, heartbeat, subagents, task runner, dashboard,
and the Slack Socket Mode connection.

Event routing, interactive button handling, and allowlist management
live in sibling modules:

- ``events``        — Socket Mode event dispatch + dedup
- ``interactions``  — Block Kit button routing
- ``allowlist``     — tracking-channel join prompts + config persistence

def _channel_transport_permitted(member: str) -> bool:
    """Return True only if the ``channels`` scope POSITIVELY permits *member*.

    Gates each transport's STARTUP on the same ``channels`` ScopedMap the two
    OUTBOUND chokepoints consult: outbound-send
    (``mcp_core._vet_channel_governance``) and outbound cross-surface mirroring
    (``dashboard.chat_runner._resolve_mirror_target``).  So one ``channels``
    policy governs a transport consistently at connect and on every outbound
    path — this gate is the connect-time member.  INBOUND receive is gated
    separately and per-message by ``messaging.identity.channel_inbound_permitted``
    (called at the top of each dispatcher's ``handle_message``), so a deny added
    after connect stops dispatch without a restart.  *member* is the transport's
    ``channel_type`` (``slack`` / ``wecom`` / ``telegram`` / ``discord`` /
    ``webex``) — the IDENTICAL member id the outbound + inbound gates use, so one
    allowlist covers them all.  **Slack is NOT exempt**: it is gated in
    ``_connect_slack`` (which also drops the socket client on a deny so nothing
    can reconnect it), while the other four are gated in
    ``_start_channel_transports``.

    HOST-side resolution mirrors the canonical
    ``apps.manager._app_activation_denied`` template:

    * ``session_key=HOST_SESSION_KEY`` — starting a transport is an operator/host
      action, so it is governed by the policy ceiling AND any ``bind: {type:
      surface, id: host}`` profile.  An empty key would classify to surface
      ``unknown`` and silently ignore a host profile (and historically
      mis-classified to ``slack``); the same fix ``apps/manager`` and
      ``slack/enterprise.py`` apply.
    * Both the DENY and the ALLOW decision are audited here via
      ``sel().log_governance_decision`` — ``governance_permits`` audits only its
      own degrade, not a normal permit/deny, so the caller owns both.

    Default-build invariant: with no policy governing ``channels`` (the standard
    open-source case) ``governance_permits`` returns a permitting Decision, so
    every ENABLED transport starts exactly as before — byte-identical behavior.

    Connect-time + inbound: this gate is the CONNECT-time member. A separate
    per-message inbound gate (``messaging.identity.channel_inbound_permitted``,
    called at the top of each dispatcher's ``handle_message``) rechecks the same
    ``channels`` policy on every inbound message, so a host-profile deny added
    AFTER a transport connected stops dispatching without a restart. Together they
    cover connect + inbound; the outbound chokepoints cover sends.

    Audit + error posture (exact):

    * GOVERNED allow (a policy/profile governs ``channels`` → ``rule !=
      "default"``): **audit-or-deny**. The allow SEL is written with
      ``critical=True`` (synchronous + raising), so a persistence failure
      (unwritable SEL / full disk) propagates to the outer ``except`` and DENIES
      the start — a policy-governed transport never connects unaudited. This is
      why ``critical`` is required: the default background writer SWALLOWS disk
      failures, so a best-effort allow-audit would let the transport connect even
      when its audit record never landed.
    * UNGOVERNED allow (no policy governs ``channels`` — the default OSS build →
      ``rule == "default"`` / ``_PERMIT_NOT_GOVERNED``): **best-effort**
      (``critical=False``). OSS transport availability must never depend on SEL
      disk health when the operator configured no governance at all.
    * DENY: best-effort audit (the transport is not starting either way).
    * ERROR: **fail-closed**. A transport is an externally-reachable network
      surface, so it starts ONLY on a positive permit. We pass
      ``governance_permits(fail_closed=True)`` so an internal
      governance-evaluation error yields a DENYING Decision, and the outer
      ``except Exception`` ALSO denies (``return False`` + a ``failed_closed=True``
      degrade audit) — deny-by-default on any error, never an unaudited connect.
      This deliberately DIVERGES from ``apps.manager`` /
      ``mcp_core._vet_channel_governance`` (which fail open) because they gate
      in-process actions, not a network-reachable listener.  A
      ``PlatformCompositionError`` still propagates (a broken CPP composition must
      abort, not silently deny).

        governance scope: a policy that denies the transport member keeps it from
        connecting at all, and its client stays ``None``. The member ids are
        IDENTICAL to the outbound chokepoints — outbound-send (``mcp_core``) and
        outbound cross-surface mirroring (``chat_runner``) — so one ``channels``
        allowlist governs a transport at connect time and on every outbound path
        (inbound receive is gated per-message by
        ``messaging.identity.channel_inbound_permitted``).

        Default-build invariant: with no policy governing ``channels`` (the
        standard OSS build) the gate permits, so every transport starts exactly
        as before — byte-identical behavior. Slack is a registry member too
        (``start=None``) but is gated in ``_connect_slack`` rather than here,
        because it owns its own socket-client lifecycle (a deny must drop that
        client, not just skip a start call).

        Loop hygiene: ``_channel_transport_permitted`` reaches
        ``ProfileStore._ensure_fresh``, which stats/reads the profile files off
        disk — blocking I/O. This method runs on the gateway event loop (inside
        ``run()``), so the governance decisions are computed together in an
        executor BEFORE any transport is started; only the actual factory
        awaits stay on the loop.

        Enabled-only eval: the gate is queried ONLY for a transport whose
        ``_<member>_enabled`` is set (config-enabled + credentialed). A transport
        that is off never starts regardless of policy, so evaluating it would only
        emit a spurious deny-SEL for a channel that was never going to connect.
        A member not evaluated defaults to not-permitted (it is off anyway), so
        the no-policy default is unchanged: every ENABLED transport still resolves
        to permit and starts exactly as before.
