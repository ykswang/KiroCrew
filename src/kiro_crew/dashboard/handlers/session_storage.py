"""Dashboard endpoints for session storage: what it costs, and reclaiming it.

Read is open; every mutation is gated on :func:`_is_restricted_session` and
audited through the SEL, because all three of them move or delete a user's
conversation history.

The wire shape deliberately reports a session as ONE size. Sessions occupy two
stores underneath (see :mod:`kiro_crew.session_storage`), but that is an
implementation detail the reader cannot act on, so it is neither split out here
nor derivable from these payloads.

Reclaiming stages files in a trash rather than deleting them, which means the
reclaim itself does not return space to the filesystem. ``trash`` carries the
staged total precisely so a client can say so; a client that reports a reclaim as
freed space is lying to the user.

    nothing. That is the right guarantee for the module — a selection either
    happens or it does not — but it makes a bulk screen useless if a single row
