    """Build the DNS-rebinding ``Host``-header barrier middleware.

    SHARED by BOTH entrypoints (``start_dashboard`` and the ``--slack-only``
    ``start_api_server``) so the two chains can never drift — same rationale
    as ``_STRICT_INTERNAL_API_PATHS`` above. In particular this is the SINGLE
    exemption point for ``origin.PROBE_PATHS``: a change to the exemption is
    necessarily a change in both servers, where test_api_health.py pins it
    through a real middleware chain (disallowed-Host probe allowed,
    disallowed-Host non-probe denied).

    Rejects any request whose ``Host`` header does not name a host we serve.
    Runs on EVERY method (GET data-exfil is the rebinding payload) and
    independently of the CSRF Origin check and loopback trust — a rebound
    request is loopback at the socket but forges ``Host``. See
    ``origin.check_host`` for the missing-Host and empty-allowlist
    deny-by-default carve-outs.

    Probe exemption: orchestrator health probes (kubelet, Docker HEALTHCHECK,
    LBs) address the gateway by container/pod IP, which by construction is
    never in the host allowlist. The probe handlers are token-free/secret-free
    and additionally gate their identity fields on ``check_host``, so
    exempting them leaks nothing a rebound page could not already infer from
    a bare TCP connect (see ``origin.PROBE_PATHS``). This is a permanent,
    deliberate carve-out in a security control: treat ANY addition to
    ``PROBE_PATHS`` as a security review.

    ``caller`` labels the SEL audit line (``dashboard_user`` for the full
    dashboard, ``mcp_tool`` for the headless API server).

# IPv6 loopback ([::1]) is deliberately OMITTED. A CSP host-source that pairs a
# bracketed IPv6 literal with a wildcard port — `http://[::1]:*` — is invalid
# per the CSP grammar, so Chromium drops that ENTIRE source and logs
# "contains an invalid source: 'http://[::1]:*'". Because the source was being
# dropped anyway, `[::1]:*` never actually admitted anything; removing it is
# behaviour-preserving for IPv4 loopback (127.0.0.1 / localhost / 0.0.0.0, whose
# non-bracketed literals accept a wildcard port) and only silences the console
# error the pet page surfaced. There is no wildcard-port form Chromium accepts
# for a bracketed IPv6 host, so IPv6 loopback preview cannot be expressed here
# without pinning a specific port — which the arbitrary-port preview use case

    Without this the tunnel is started (``tunnel/setup.py`` → ``TunnelManager.start()``)
    and then NEVER stopped: ``TunnelManager.stop()`` had no production caller, so
    whatever the active ``TunnelProvider`` brought up outlived the gateway — even
    on a clean Ctrl+C. A companion provider that supervises a child process
    leaked it (reparented to PID 1) and the next gateway start collided on the
    same tunnel name. The manager is edition-neutral, so stopping it here tears
    down EVERY provider (the public Default's ``stop()`` is a no-op).

    Registered like the other long-lived subsystems (``_watchdog_shutdown``,
    ``_register_instances_hooks``): the hook is appended BEFORE ``runner.setup()``
    freezes the app's signal lists, and reads ``state.tunnel_manager`` lazily —
    the manager is only assigned later, after ``setup_tunnel`` runs, and this
    hook fires at shutdown, long after that assignment. That lazy read is also
    what lets the REGISTRATION sit first in ``start_dashboard``: ``on_cleanup``
    handlers are dispatched in registration order under a hard shutdown
    deadline, so a tunnel hook queued behind the other subsystems can be starved
    (instances cleanup waiting on SSH children that ignore SIGTERM eats the
    deadline, the gateway force-exits, and the tunnel is never stopped).

    Two teardown paths, because a live tunnel does not imply a manager:
    ``setup_tunnel`` builds a ``TunnelManager`` and the hook stops that, but the
    on-demand link path (``slack.use_tunnel_url`` →
    ``current_context().tunnel.ensure_available()`` in ``slack/allowlist.py``)
    provisions and starts a tunnel straight on the provider and never constructs
    a manager. With ``state.tunnel_manager`` still None, bailing out left exactly
    the orphan this hook exists to prevent, so the no-manager path stops
    ``current_context().tunnel`` directly. Only one path runs per shutdown — the
    manager delegates to the same provider — so nothing is stopped twice.

    Failure containment: ``on_cleanup`` handlers run in sequence and a raise
    aborts the remaining ones, so a tunnel teardown must never propagate. BOTH
    paths go through ``_stop_bounded``: the stop is bounded by
    ``_TUNNEL_STOP_TIMEOUT_SECS`` and every exception is logged and swallowed, so
    neither a hanging nor a raising provider — nor a fail-closed
    ``current_context()`` — can block or crash the rest of gateway shutdown.
    ``TunnelManager.stop()`` is itself idempotent (it re-delegates and, on
    failure, simply declines to pin STOPPED) and a provider ``stop()`` is
    expected to be too, so a shutdown path that runs twice is harmless on either
    path.
