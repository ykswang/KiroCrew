# ── Built-in Denied-Command Rules ──
# The canonical catalog of built-in denied commands.  Each rule is a Python
# REGEX (matched case-insensitively via ``re.search``) with a stable ``id``
# (the opt-out key + SEL audit key), a ``category`` for UI grouping, and a
# human ``description``.  Rules are DEFAULT-ON but user-disableable from
# Settings → Security; a governance ``commands``-scope policy can force-pin a
# rule as un-opt-out-able (see ``platform/governance.py``).  Enforcement is at
# KiroCrew's own ``hooks.py`` PreToolUse gate — these are NOT injected into the
# kiro-cli agent spec.
#
# The always-on keystone controls (``_is_git_publish``,
# ``is_sensitive_bash_command``, ``audit_bash_exfiltration``,
# ``_check_imds_access``, ``_ENV_CRED_PATTERNS``, ``_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS``) are
# independent and un-disableable; they run BEFORE the rule tiers.

# ── ReDoS mitigation for the regex deny tier ──
# The 137 built-in rule patterns were authored for kiro-cli's linear-time
# (RE2-style) engine.  Under Python's backtracking ``re`` two independent
# pathologies appear on hostile input, so the raw patterns must never be fed to
# ``re.search`` verbatim.  ``_DenyMatcher`` compiles each pattern into a
# behaviourally-identical but linear-time matcher and matches against the FULL
# (untruncated) string, so a destructive needle at any offset is always found.
# All of this is EVALUATION-LAYER only — ``BUILTIN_DENIED_RULES`` (and the
# golden fixture the parity test pins to) stay byte-for-byte unchanged, and the
# human-readable denial reason / SEL audit still report the ORIGINAL pattern.
#
# Pathology 1 — catastrophic (exponential) backtracking.
#   The 46 ``aws-*`` patterns embed the nested-star flag run
#   ``(?:\s+--?[a-z-]+(?:[= ]\S+)?)*``.  Two internal ambiguities make it
#   exponential: (a) ``--?`` and ``[a-z-]+`` can both claim the leading dashes
#   of a flag; (b) a space-separated value ``[= ]\S+`` can equally be read as
#   the next flag.  On input like ``aws -x -x -x …`` (only ~40 repeats / ~124
#   chars) the engine explores 2ⁿ parses before failing — a length bound does
#   NOT help because the blow-up happens well below any sane bound.  We rewrite
#   the run to ``_LINEARIZED_AWS_FLAG_RUN`` which removes BOTH ambiguities
#   (``--?``→``-`` for the flag name, and a negative lookahead so a space value
#   cannot itself be a flag token).  This is provably language-equivalent — see
#   ``test_denied_commands_security`` ReDoS tests and the exhaustive
#   brute-force/directional equivalence checks documented there.
#
# Pathology 2 — polynomial (O(n²)/O(n³)) backtracking.
#   Every ``.*``-prefixed pattern (~50 of them) and the multi-``.*`` chains
#   (e.g. ``python.*open.*/\.ssh/``) are linear/polynomial per pattern but scan
#   the whole string, so across ~123 effective patterns a 20k-char input costs
#   seconds.  These ``.*`` occur ONLY at the TOP LEVEL of the ported patterns

# The 137 built-in patterns are ReDoS-safe by construction (the one dangerous
# construct — the aws flag run — is rewritten by ``_linearize_deny_pattern``,
# and the git-publish patterns never reach the regex tier).  But a USER can add
# an ARBITRARY regex via ``POST /api/security/denied-commands/user``; a
# catastrophic-backtracking pattern such as ``(a+)+$`` would then run inside the
# synchronous PreToolUse gate on the event loop and could freeze the gateway
# (2ⁿ backtracking is NOT bounded by scanning a length-limited prefix — the
# blow-up happens far below any byte bound).  ``is_safe_user_regex`` is a
# conservative, stdlib-only STRUCTURAL check used both at the add boundary
# (reject with HTTP 400) and as runtime defense-in-depth in ``_DenyMatcher``
# (an already-stored unsafe pattern is skipped, never executed).
#
# Heuristic (the classic exponential family): a pattern is UNSAFE if it contains
# a QUANTIFIED GROUP — one whose quantifier permits >1 repetitions (``*``,
# ``+``, ``{m,}``, ``{m,n}`` with n>1, ``{n}`` with n>1) — whose body itself
# contains EITHER (a) another quantifier (nested quantifier: ``(X+)+``,
# ``(X*)*``, ``(X?)*`` …) OR (b) a top-level alternation (branch-overlap risk:
# ``(a|a)+``, ``(ab|a)+``).  We deliberately err toward REJECTING a suspicious
# user pattern: built-ins are unaffected (they are added programmatically, never
# through this gate), and a user who hits a false positive can rephrase without
# the nested quantifier.  We first strip the known-safe linearized aws flag run
# so the (harmless) built-in construct is never mistaken for the dangerous

# than a substring.  Mirrors the anchored regex in
# ``config/defaults.json`` deniedCommands.
#
# ``git [<-c k=v>...] [<-C path>...] push ...`` is a publish.  Intervening
# tokens may only be options (``-x``) or option-with-value pairs
# (``-C /path``, ``-c core.x=y``) — a bare non-flag token before ``push``
# (e.g. ``stash``) means ``push`` is NOT the subcommand, so ``git stash push``
# is correctly allowed.  Anchored to a segment start (optionally preceded by a
# command separator) so ``git log --grep push`` is not matched.
#
# The trailing terminator is a lookahead that accepts whitespace, end-of-string,
# OR a shell metacharacter that closes/terminates the segment — so a bare
# ``git push`` (no remote/branch, valid: pushes current branch to the default
# remote) is still caught inside ``$(git push)``, `` `git push` ``, ``git push|cat``,

#
# They are DELIBERATELY NOT in ``_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`` above: that list is the
# shared read+write gate, and reading config.json is routine and intended (the
# dashboard file viewer, ``cat``, and knowledge indexing all read it). We
# instead block only WRITES, at the agent file-edit tool gate
# (hooks.on_tool_call), via ``is_sensitive_write_path``. This is defense in
# depth on top of the loader's load-time clamp, which already neutralizes any
# inflated on-disk value no matter how it was written. The operator edits config
# out-of-band (dashboard config API / CLI), which do NOT route through this
# gate, so legitimate config changes still work.
# (The denied-command opt-out state does NOT live here — it is a security
# ceiling and lives on the read+write keystone floor in ``denied_commands.json``

# enable is on that same floor, for the same reason.)

# addition to either list here can see any of it. That is why
# ``computer_use/policy.py``'s bundle-id denylist (terminals, password managers,
# keychains) and its secure-subrole refusal are load-bearing security controls in
# their own right rather than conveniences, and why the always-on secure-field

# ── Bash-layer protection for write-protected leaves ──
# Leaf files under the crew home that a bash command must not be able to
# CREATE/MODIFY/DELETE. The file-edit tool gate already blocks tool writes to
# these via ``is_sensitive_write_path``; this closes the SHELL path, which the
# sensitive-command regex below otherwise only enforces for
# ``_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS``.
#
# We block ANY bash command that NAMES one of these leaves — the same
# verb-INDEPENDENT backstop the sensitive-dir matcher uses — rather than an
# enumerated write-verb allowlist: a narrow allowlist is inherently bypassable
# (quoted redirects ``> "$HOME/.../marker"``, ``cp``, ``python -c "open(...,'w')"``,
# or any novel write verb slip past it). Naming-based blocking incidentally
# denies bash READS of these leaves too, which is harmless: they carry no secret
# (so this is NOT in ``_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`` — file-read tools and
# ``is_sensitive_path`` stay unaffected), and the only legitimate readers
# (``kirocrew doctor``, the migration code) use Python ``os`` calls, not bash.
#
# The data-home marker is the sole entry: its mere PRESENCE is the migration
# trust signal, and — unlike config.json, whose inflated values the loader
# clamps at load time regardless of how they were written — nothing neutralizes
# a planted marker. A prompt-injected agent that shell-plants it into a
# pre-migration home makes the next boot skip migration and ignore the legacy
# home's governance policy + secrets; shell-deleting it forces a needless
# re-migration. The migration code stamps it directly in Python (not via bash),
# so legitimate stamping is unaffected. Kept as a literal to avoid a
# config->security import cycle; a drift guard in the tests pins it to
# ``MIGRATION_MARKER_NAME``.
#
# SCOPE NOTE (please do NOT flag incremental regex gaps as new HIGHs): this
# bash gate is DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH, not the primary control. The primary control
# is the file-edit tool gate (`is_sensitive_write_path`, above) plus the fact
# that the migration stamps the marker only from Python, never a tool/shell.
# Like the credential/sensitive-dir rules, the bash matcher is HOME-ANCHORED and
# shares their intrinsic limits — a `cd <home> && touch <leaf>` bare-relative
# write, or an unusual `${VAR}`/quoting form, can evade the regex exactly as it
# can for `~/.aws/credentials`. Chasing shell-parser completeness here is a
# losing game and holds the marker to a higher bar than credentials get; the
# realistic residual threat (skipping a one-time session-data copy) is low and
# already covered on the tool path. Widen this only via the SHARED matcher (so
# credentials benefit too), not with marker-only special cases.
#
# ``rotation.yaml`` is the second entry, and it meets the bar the scope note sets rather than
# being a special case: it is an INPUT TO AN AUTHORIZATION DECISION, not merely a
# security-relevant setting. An agent that rewrites it to name its own login makes
# ``rotation.authorize_action`` -> ``_definitely_off_shift`` accept a forged shift and execute a
# production write against a teammate's incident tooling — and unlike ``config.json``, whose
# inflated values the loader clamps, nothing downstream neutralizes a forged schedule entry.
# The tool-path gate (``is_sensitive_write_path``) is still the primary control; this closes the
# shell path for the same reason it is closed for the marker. Reads stay allowed on BOTH paths:
# every teammate's instance must read the file to answer "am I on call?", and it holds no
# secret. ``ledger_sync`` converges the file with a direct ``git checkout``, not through this
# gate, so team sync is unaffected.
# Entries are HOME-RELATIVE PATHS under the crew home, not bare filenames: the matcher
# builds ``<home>/<crew-prefix>/<entry>``. `rotation.yaml` therefore carries its
# ``apps/.../data/`` subpath — spelling it as a bare leaf silently matched nothing, which is
# the failure mode where a security addition reads as done and enforces nothing.
#
# The incident INDEX is the third, on the same reasoning one step over: it is what
# ``/incident/action`` reads to decide WHICH signal the autonomy gate is authorizing, so an
# agent that rewrites it can have the gate approve one signal while the sink mutates another.
# Reads stay allowed for the same reason as the schedule — it is the board every instance
# renders, and it holds no secret.

# skills-tree walk made thousands of identical calls and took 4.2s, of which
# 3.5s was this rebuild.
#
# Deliberately TTL-bounded rather than a plain ``lru_cache``: part of the set is
# derived from FILESYSTEM state, so an unbounded cache would keep matching a
# stale target if a symlink were repointed after the cache warmed — a gate that
# fails OPEN. A few seconds bounds that window.
#
# The key is built from the RESOLVED roots (``Path.home().resolve()`` and the
# resolved ``KIROCREW_HOME``), NOT from the raw env vars, because those two
# values are exactly what the builder anchors its targets on. Keying on the raw
# ``$HOME`` string was wrong twice over:
#   1. Repointing a symlink AT ``$HOME`` leaves ``$HOME`` unchanged while every
#      target moves, so the gate returned False for a credential path the
#      uncached code blocked (a real, reproduced bypass — see the regression
#      test ``test_repointed_home_symlink_is_not_served_from_cache``).
#   2. ``Path.home()`` reads ``USERPROFILE`` on Windows and never ``HOME``, so on
#      that platform the key omitted the one variable that decides the anchor.
# Resolving the roots costs ~2 realpath calls (~0.06ms) against the ~1.14ms
# rebuild it replaces, so the win survives.
#
# Residual, accepted: a symlink swapped DEEPER inside the crew home (an
# individual keystone leaf, or an intermediate directory on the way to one) can
# still be served stale for up to the TTL. Detecting that needs the per-leaf
# realpath calls that ARE the expense — measured 45 realpath calls per build,
# 94% of its 1.39ms — so there is no cheap way to keep the cache and revalidate
# them.
#
# The TTL is therefore sized as small as it can be while still doing its job.
# The value is 0.1s, NOT a "few seconds", because a skills walk issues thousands
# of calls in a burst and one build serves the whole burst either way. Measured
# cold-walk cost against this constant:
#     5.0s -> 0.95s    1.0s -> 0.93s    0.1s -> 0.95s    0.0s -> 4.66s
# So 0.1s keeps the entire win while cutting the stale window 50x versus 5.0s.
# Only 0.0 (no cache) closes the window completely, and that reverts to the 4.7s
# scan whose GIL-held cost wedges the event loop — the defect this exists to fix.

    We therefore check MULTIPLE candidate forms of the input and return True if
    ANY of them lands in a matched location:

      1. the fully symlink-RESOLVED canonical target (``realpath`` /
         ``Path.resolve`` — follows every symlink in the chain, including
         intermediate directories and the final component).  This is what
         defeats the symlink bypass: the resolved target of the link is
         ``~/.aws/credentials`` even though the link's own name is benign.
      2. the LEXICALLY-normalized path (no symlink following) and the raw
         expanded string — so a path that *textually* names a matched dir is
         still caught when resolution fails (dangling link, permission error).

    ``base_dir`` anchors a *relative* input against the caller's known working
    directory (e.g. the agent's workspace cwd) so a relative title like
    ``sub/cfg.ini`` resolves against the real directory rather than whatever CWD
    the gateway process happens to have.  Absolute inputs are unaffected;
    ``base_dir=None`` preserves the historical CWD-relative behavior.

    #      from a header mentioned inline in prose (LLM output, docs) to the end
    #      of the string — silently deleting all trailing lines. Requiring a
    #      leading newline per line means an inline header in prose (real key

    #      material. RFC 1421 ENCRYPTED PEMs put a MANDATORY blank line between
    #      the ``DEK-Info:`` header and the base64 body; without this lookahead
    #      the per-line "every continuation must contain a base64 char" rule
    #      stopped at that blank line and leaked the whole encrypted body (for

    # 64-char alphabet, of which exactly 2 are `-`/`_`. The 43rd carries only the
    # leftover 4 bits (256 - 42*6), and they land in the HIGH bits of its 6-bit
    # group with the low 2 bits zero, so it spans exactly the 16 alphabet indices
    # divisible by 4 (`048AEIMQUYcgkosw`) and can never be `-`/`_`, which sit at
    # 62/63. Hence P(no `-`/`_`) = (62/64)^42 = 26.4%, verified by encoding all
    # 256 possible final digest bytes.
    # So roughly a quarter of tokens had only the signature replaced (leaving the
    # payload claims verbatim in a URL that still looked complete but no longer
    # authenticated), and the other ~74% streamed out entirely unredacted. Matching the whole token here makes
    # the outcome deterministic and replaces it as one unit. The 2-segment token gets
    # its OWN alternative rather than relaxing the segment floor to `{1,4}`. Relaxing
    # the floor over-redacts ordinary code and prose, because the pattern has no left
    # boundary and post-header segments allow an EMPTY match: `keyJson.get(raw)` then
    # redacts to `k[REDACTED…](raw)`, and a JWT quoted at the end of a sentence loses
    # its trailing period. The 2-segment alternative therefore carries a left boundary
    # (`(?<![A-Za-z0-9_.-])`, as `_BARE_SECRET_RUN_RE` already does, plus `.` so an
    # attribute access `obj.eyJ…` is excluded too) and per-segment lengths taken from
    # the generator, not from guesswork, because a length FLOOR alone is beatable by a
    # sufficiently verbose identifier: at `{40,}` the 40-char
    # `eyJsonSerializerConfigurationFactoryBuilder.deserializeFromStringValue` matched.
    #
    # `token_auth._sign` is HMAC-SHA256 base64url-unpadded, so the signature is
    # EXACTLY 43 chars for every token ever minted; that is a property of the digest,
    # not of the payload, so it is pinned as `{43}` rather than a floor. See
    # `test_link_token_signature_is_43_chars`, which fails loudly if `_sign` changes
    # digest, instead of letting redaction silently stop matching.
    #
    # `generate_token` always emits 6 claims (`sub`/`exp`/`session_exp`/`iat`/`nonce`/
    # `gen`), with a 16-hex-char nonce and float timestamps; `app`, `prompt` and
    # `extra` only ADD. Payload length is NOT fixed. It scales with `len(sub)`, and
    # `json.dumps` writes each float timestamp at its own repr width, which base64
    # then quantises into 4-char steps. So the floor is derived, not sampled: a
    # 1-char `sub` (the narrowest a caller passes: the app validator requires at
    # least one char and the other call sites supply a literal fallback), `gen=0`,
    # and all three timestamps at their shortest 12-char repr (an exactly-integral
    # `time.time()` in the current 10-digit epoch era) measures 145 chars past
    # `eyJ`, which leaves the `{96,}` floor 49 chars of headroom against a future
    # shorter claim set while still excluding `eyJ2IjoxfQ.json`. ONLY that derived
    # floor is pinned, by `test_link_token_payload_clears_the_96_char_floor`, which
    # reads the bound from the compiled pattern and the claim keys from a real mint
    # so a dropped claim fails loudly instead of silently disabling redaction. Live
    # payloads are much larger and are NOT pinned, because the exact spread moves
    # with float reprs and caller mix: measured 168-185 for the mandatory-only
    # callers and 192-223 for the two that also pass `app=` (`handlers/core.py`,
    # `token_auth.py`), which adds an `"app"` claim.
    #
    # Order matters: the 3-to-5-segment
    # alternative is tried first at each position, so a real JWS still redacts whole
    # instead of matching `header.payload` and leaving `.signature` exposed.
    # The 3-to-5-segment alternative keeps `*` (not `+`) on post-header segments so an
    # EMPTY segment still counts: a compact JWE with direct
    # (`alg:dir`) or key-agreement (`ECDH-ES`) key management has an empty Encrypted
    # Key (2nd) segment — shape `header..iv.ciphertext.tag` — which a `+` quantifier
    # would fail to match, leaking the ciphertext + tag.
    # The HTTP `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header carries opaque or JWT bearer
    # creds. The JWT alternative is case-sensitive (`eyJ` is a fixed base64url
    # prefix). The header name + scheme are matched case-insensitively via scoped
    # `(?i:…)` groups because HTTP header names are case-insensitive (RFC 7230
    # §3.2), HTTP/2 mandates lowercase names, and the `Bearer` scheme is
    # case-insensitive (RFC 6750 §2.1) — so `authorization: bearer …` emitted by
    # requests / net/http / HTTP2 frame logs is redacted too. The separator is
    # JSON-aware: an optional quote may precede the
    # `:`/`=` and the token, so a serialized header `{"Authorization": "Bearer
    # <tok>"}` in a structured-log/JSON request dump is redacted as well. Both
    # alternatives are scoped tightly: the JWT segment class cannot cross the
    # literal `.` separators and the Bearer token class (`[A-Za-z0-9._~+/-]`, RFC
    # 6750 `b64token`) stops at whitespace/quotes, so neither over-captures. A
    # Bearer header carrying a JWT redacts as one match (the Bearer class subsumes
    # the JWT); a bare JWT is still caught independently (defense in depth).

# boundaries: a chunk ending ``...AKIA`` and the next starting ``IOSFODNN7...``
# each individually escape redact_credentials(), so the raw fragments reach
# WebSocket/SSE consumers even though the final assembled message is redacted.
# StreamRedactor withholds the trailing run of "credential-class" characters
# (which could be the start of a not-yet-complete credential) until a
# terminator arrives or the stream ends, redacting only the confirmed-safe
# prefix before it is emitted on the wire.

# Characters that can appear inside a credential token/pattern. A credential is
# a contiguous run of these; any byte OUTSIDE this set terminates an in-progress
# match, so text up to (and including) such a terminator is safe to redact and
# emit. Includes URL / base64 / connection-string punctuation so exfil URLs and
# DB URIs are also held intact across chunk boundaries — plus quotes and URL
# query delimiters (``"`` ``'`` ``?&#``) so a JSON key/value or query-string
# secret is not committed piecemeal across a chunk edge. (The private-key HEADER
# phrase contains spaces and is the one pattern that can split on a terminator;
# it is a non-secret header string and the final full-text pass still redacts
# the persisted/displayed copy.)

# `Bearer ` prefix in one chunk and the opaque token in the next — redacting
# neither, since the batch `Authorization:\s*Bearer` pattern only fires when the

# anchor followed by a token then whitespace no longer matches (`\s+` after the

# fails the match and is released immediately. Case-INSENSITIVE and JSON-aware to
# mirror the batch pattern: HTTP/2 lower-cases header names (`authorization:` /
# `bearer`) and JSON shapes the header as `{"Authorization": "Bearer <tok>"}` (a
# quote before the `:` and before the token), so the anchor tolerates an optional
# quote around `[:=]` and folds the `Authorization`/`Bearer` words — otherwise a
# lowercase or JSON-shaped anchor split across chunks would not be held and its
# token would leak. Opaque OAuth/refresh/SSO Bearer tokens carry no `eyJ` header,

    ── Two tiers ──
    * Regex tier (``denied_regexes``): the effective enabled built-in rule
      regexes plus user-added regexes (output of ``compute_effective_denied``),
      matched via ``re.search`` (``re.IGNORECASE``).  When ``None``, FAILS
      CLOSED to all built-ins enabled.
    * Glob tier (``extra_patterns``): legacy ``auto_deny_tools`` + companion
      overlay globs, matched via ``fnmatch`` exactly as before.

    ── Two-pass evaluation ──
    Pass 1 (whole-string): every deny pattern is matched against the
    full input.  If a pattern matches and **no exception pattern also
    matches the full input**, the input is denied immediately.  This
    closes evasion vectors where the deny string spans a separator
    boundary that per-segment splitting would erase, e.g.
    ``git$(echo ' ')push origin main`` (which bash evaluates to
    ``git push origin main``): the whole string contains both ``git`` and
    ``push`` so the broad ``*git*push*`` glob matches, and there is no
    matching exception, so the command is denied at this stage even
    though splitting on ``$(`` / ``)`` would otherwise produce no
    segment containing both substrings.

    Pass 2 (per-segment) only runs if pass 1 found a deny match **and**
    the full input also matched at least one exception for that pattern.
    The input is split on shell command separators (``;``, ``&&``,
    ``||``, ``|``, newlines) and command-substitution boundaries
    (``$(``, ``)``, backticks) into segments, and each segment is
    re-evaluated independently.  This preserves the chaining-bypass
    protection (any embedded real
    publish lives in its own segment and matches the deny pattern in its
    own right) while allowing the legitimate stash-in-pipeline case
    that the prior whole-string design over-blocked.

    Edge cases & limitations:
      - Pass-1 deny is conservative: anything matching a deny glob with
        no exception is blocked, even if the input is structurally
        contorted.
      - Pass-2 splitting is purely textual; quoted strings and escaped
        separators are split anyway (over-blocking is the safer
        direction).
      - Heredoc bodies, ``eval``, ``bash -c``, etc., are not parsed
        specially.  If those become evasion vectors in practice, add
        explicit deny patterns for them.

    Audit:
      - Every denial path emits a ``deny_event`` SEL event via
        ``_emit_deny_event``.
      - Every granted exception emits a ``deny_exception`` SEL event via
        ``_emit_deny_exception_event`` (fail-closed: if SEL logging
        fails the exception is not granted).

    Args:
        tool_name: The full command line / tool invocation to evaluate.
        extra_patterns: Optional fnmatch glob patterns (glob tier — legacy
            ``auto_deny_tools`` + companion overlay).
        denied_regexes: The effective enabled rule regexes (regex tier).  When
            ``None``, fails closed to all built-in rules enabled.
        reason_notes: Optional ``{pattern: operator note}`` map.  When the pattern
            that matched has a note, the note is appended to the refusal on its
            OWN line.  Presentation only — it never affects whether something is
            denied.

    Reads limits from the ``resource_limits`` config section:
      - ``max_processes``: RLIMIT_NPROC (process count for the child's UID).
      - ``max_open_files``: RLIMIT_NOFILE (open file descriptors).
      - ``max_cpu_seconds``: RLIMIT_CPU in seconds (``0`` disables — default).
      - ``max_memory_mb``: RLIMIT_AS (virtual address space) in MB (``0``
        disables — default; see the RLIMIT_AS caveat in ``_RLIMIT_DEFAULTS``).

    Each key accepts a positive integer to set that limit, or ``0`` to leave the
    limit unchanged (inherited). Missing keys fall back to ``_RLIMIT_DEFAULTS``.
    A requested limit is always clamped DOWN to the inherited hard limit — we
    never try to *raise* a ceiling (an unprivileged child cannot, and the
    attempt would raise), so this can only tighten, never loosen, the child's
    budget.

    The returned callable is intended for use as ``preexec_fn`` in
    ``subprocess.Popen`` / ``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec``. It runs in the
    child process after fork but before exec — setrlimit calls here only affect
    the child. It is a no-op on non-POSIX platforms (``resource`` unavailable)
    and degrades gracefully per-limit on platforms lacking a specific rlimit
    (e.g. macOS has no RLIMIT_NPROC / a flaky RLIMIT_AS).

    NOTE: ``preexec_fn`` runs post-fork in a subprocess that may be
    multi-threaded; it MUST stay async-signal-safe — only ``getrlimit`` /
    ``setrlimit`` here, no allocation-heavy or lock-taking work.

    Args:
        config: Full KiroCrew config dict (or any subset containing
            ``resource_limits``). Pass None for defaults.
