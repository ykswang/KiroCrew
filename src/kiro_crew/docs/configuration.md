# Configuration Reference

Everything Kiro Crew remembers about how it should behave lives in one JSON file,
`~/.kiro/crew/config.json`, created automatically on the first `kirocrew gateway`
run. Most keys are also editable from the dashboard's Settings pages, and this
page is the reference for the ones that are not: what they mean, what they
default to, and which environment variables outrank them.

## Managing Config

```bash
kirocrew config get                    # print full config
kirocrew config get agent.model        # print a specific value
kirocrew config set agent.model auto   # set a value (auto type detection)
kirocrew config set --local agent.model auto   # write config.local.json instead
kirocrew config edit                   # open in $EDITOR
```

Every config change is audit-logged to the security event log.

`config.local.json` holds overrides that survive an upgrade, which is what
`--local` writes to. Its values win over `config.json`.

The dashboard port is **not** a config key: set `KIROCREW_PORT` instead.

## Node Toolchain

Playwright Browser Mode uses Node.js `>=18` to run `@playwright/mcp`. Node tools
resolve from `KIROCREW_NODE_BIN_DIR`, then `<data-home>/node-bin-dir`, supported
version-manager layouts, and finally the inherited `PATH`.

`ensure-node.sh` writes the marker automatically when it provisions Node. An
operator can also write one absolute bin directory to the marker manually. For
the default data home on macOS or Linux:

```bash
node -p 'require("path").dirname(process.execPath)' > ~/.kiro/crew/node-bin-dir
```

Desktop apps launched by Finder or Dock do not source `~/.zshrc`, and Kiro Crew
does not guess package-manager-specific directories such as Homebrew's defaults.
Write the directory selected by your terminal to the marker or provide it
through the desktop process environment, then fully quit and reopen Kiro Crew.
Node discovery stays cached for the gateway process lifetime, so a Settings
retry does not make a newly written executable eligible. The resolver also skips
candidates older than Node 18 instead of letting one hide a supported
installation later in the search order. The marker selects executables later
launched by the gateway, so agent tool calls cannot read or modify it; write it
only from an operator terminal.

## Sandbox

`agent.sandbox` controls whether Kiro Crew wraps the agent process in its own
OS-level sandbox (a user namespace on Linux, `sandbox-exec` on macOS).

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `off` (default) | Defer isolation to kiro-cli's own internal agent sandbox |
| `auto` | Add Kiro Crew's OS-level sandbox on top |

The two layers are mutually exclusive on macOS, because a nested seatbelt
sandbox fails with `EPERM`. That is why the default is `off`: kiro-cli already
isolates the agent, and stacking a second sandbox would break it.

Set via `kirocrew config set agent.sandbox auto`.

### Agent

| Key | Description | Default |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `agent.provider` | LLM provider backend. `"acp"` (KiroACP / kiro-cli) is the only accepted value | `"acp"` |
| `agent.default_agent` | Default agent name for new sessions. Empty resolves from the agent config | `""` |
| `agent.approval_mode` | `"auto"` or `"interactive"` | `"auto"` |
| `agent.model` | Default LLM model for new sessions. `"auto"` defers to the agent config, then to Kiro's own default. Editable from Settings → Chat → Model; a per-session model picker overrides it for that session only | `"auto"` |
| `agent.reasoning_effort` | Default reasoning effort on models that support it. One of `""`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`; `""` defers to the provider/model default. A per-session override wins | `""` |
| `agent.sandbox` | `"off"` (defer to kiro-cli) or `"auto"` (add Kiro Crew's OS-level sandbox) | `"off"` |
| `agent.streaming` | Stream response text as it is generated | `true` |
| `agent.bot_name` | Custom name the bot identifies as | `""` |
| `agent.conductor_skill` | Enable agent delegation conductor | `false` |
| `agent.max_channels` | Max concurrent agent channels (1-5) | `1` |
| `agent.max_channel_agents` | Max agents per channel (1-10) | `3` |
| `agent.log_level` | Persistent log level for the `kiro_crew` logger, applied at startup. The `--verbose` CLI flag overrides it | `"WARNING"` |
| `agent.soft_stop_budget_secs` | Seconds to wait for a cooperative cancel before hard-killing the session | `10.0` |
| `agent.max_subagents` | Max concurrent subagents. `0` auto-sizes the cap at startup from host memory/CPU and a learned per-agent cost. A pin of 1 or 2 is raised to 3, because a cap below 3 would disable auto-sizing and still run under the default | `0` |
| `agent.subagent_max_turns` | Default tool-call budget per subagent | `100` |
| `agent.spawn_min_memory_gb` | Minimum available memory (GB) to spawn a subagent (0 disables the check) | `4.0` |
| `agent.completion_keep` | Which end of the subagent transcript to keep in the completion event injected into the parent session: `"head"`, `"tail"`, or `"both"` (head + middle marker + tail) | `"head"` |
| `agent.completion_keep_chars` | Max characters retained in the completion event after applying `completion_keep`. `0` disables truncation. The full transcript stays on disk (see `subagent_result_ttl_secs`) | `3000` |
| `agent.subagent_result_ttl_secs` | How long a delivered subagent's `result.txt` is retained before the reaper prunes it, so the parent can read the full transcript on demand instead of re-running the subagent | `3600` (1h) |

### Session

| Key | Description | Default |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `session.timeout_secs` | Idle session timeout in seconds (0 disables the idle sweep) | `3600` (60 min) |
| `session.autocompact_pct` | Context usage percentage at which auto-compaction triggers (5-90) | `90.0` |
| `session.pool_size` | Number of pre-spawned kiro-cli processes kept ready for instant session start. 0 disables | `0` |
| `session.pool_agent` | Agent for warm-pool processes. Empty uses `agent.default_agent` | `""` |
| `session.pool_ttl_secs` | Max age in seconds for pooled processes, discarded at claim time. 0 disables | `1800` |
| `session.archive_retention_days` | Days to keep compacted/rotated session archives before auto-cleanup. `-1` disables cleanup | `30` |
| `session.watchdog_rss_max_mb` | Recycle a session when its process tree resident memory exceeds this many MiB. 0 disables. A session with a turn in flight is never recycled | `0` |

### Dashboard

| Key | Description | Default |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `dashboard.url` | Dashboard URL for remote access | `""` (localhost only) |
| `dashboard.restore_sessions` | Restore sessions on restart | `false` |
| `dashboard.restore_window_minutes` | Minutes after restart within which sessions can be restored | `30` |
| `dashboard.merge_queued_messages` | Concatenate follow-up messages while the agent is busy | `false` |
| `dashboard.mcp_probe_timeout_secs` | Seconds to wait for an MCP server handshake during a probe (5-120) | `15` |

### Slack

| Key | Description | Default |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `slack.allowed_users` | User records (`{slack_id, name}`) recorded for Slack access | `[]` |
| `slack.tracking_channels` | Channels to monitor for new members | `[]` |
| `slack.open_channels` | Channel records retained in config | `[]` |
| `slack.command` | Slash-command name | `"kirocrew"` |
| `slack.reactions` | Override phase reaction emojis (set a value to `null` to suppress that phase) | `{}` |
| `slack.reactions_enabled` | Show phase reactions on Slack messages | `true` |

Only the owner (`KIROCREW_OWNER_ID`) is authorized to interact over Slack.
Multi-user access and open channels are refused regardless of what these lists
contain, so treat them as bookkeeping rather than an access grant.

Other channels (Discord, Telegram, Teams, Webex, WeCom, WeChat) are configured
from the dashboard — see each channel's doc for keys and credentials.

### Speech-to-text

| Key | Description | Default |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `stt.enabled` | Enable voice-memo transcription | `true` |
| `stt.provider` | `"whisper"` (local), `"mlx"` (local, Apple silicon), or `"transcribe"` (AWS, needs the `voice` extra) | `"whisper"` |
| `stt.streaming` | Stream partial transcripts live into the dashboard input. Transcribe provider only | `false` |
| `stt.transcribe_region` | AWS region for the Transcribe API (transcribe provider only) | `"us-east-1"` |
| `stt.language_code` | Language for speech recognition, e.g. `en-US`, `fr-FR` | `"en-US"` |

### Memory and embeddings

Embeddings are always on and run in-process through the bundled
llama-cpp-python runtime. There is no server to install and no way to disable
them, so there is no enable switch here: only knobs for *which* model runs.

| Key | Description | Default |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `memory.embedding_provider` | Vector embedding backend. `"llama_cpp"` is the only accepted value; any other value in an existing config (including a legacy `"ollama"` or `"none"`) is coerced to it on load | `"llama_cpp"` |
| `memory.embedding_dim` | Output width of the embedding model in use. Must match a custom model's real width, or the load is refused | `1024` |
| `memory.embed_model_url` | Override HTTPS URL for the embedding-model GGUF download (mirrored or airgapped hosts). Empty uses the public Kiro Crew CDN. `KIROCREW_EMBED_MODEL_URL` wins over both. Downloads are sha256-verified regardless of source | `""` |
| `memory.embed_model_path` | Absolute path to a local GGUF to run **instead of** the bundled Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B. When set, the default model is never downloaded, so a custom model survives a default-model version change. Set `embedding_dim` to the model's output width. Changing the model changes the vector space, so stored embeddings are regenerated in the background. A configured-but-unreadable path fails closed (keyword search still works) rather than silently reverting to the default and re-embedding your corpus. Editable from the dashboard (Memory → Embedding Model). `KIROCREW_EMBED_MODEL_PATH` wins over this | `""` |
| `memory.embed_model_id` | Stable identifier for a custom model's vector space. Defaults to `custom:<filename>:<size>`, which cannot distinguish two different models of identical byte size, so set it explicitly if you swap between such models | `""` |
| `memory.semantic_confidence_threshold` | Minimum similarity score for a semantic search result | `0.8` |
| `memory.episodic_max_results` | Max episodic memories injected per session | `8` |
| `memory.episodic_max_count` | Max total episodic memories stored | `10000` |
| `memory.history_idle_hours` | Hours of inactivity before history consolidation | `3.0` |
| `memory.history_max_days` | Days of history to retain before pruning | `365` |

### Skills

| Key | Description | Default |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `skills.max_triggered` | Maximum skills loaded per message (>=0) | `0` |
| `skills.lazy_load` | Inject only a usage-ranked top-K of on-demand skills at session start and leave the long tail discoverable via search, so a large skills set cannot crowd out memory and lessons | `false` |

### Knowledge Library

| Key | Description | Default |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `knowledge.auto_ingest_artifacts` | Auto-ingest content-bearing local artifacts into the Knowledge Library as a searchable "Artifacts" source, kept in sync and removed when the artifact is deleted (see [Knowledge Library](knowledge-library-how-it-works.md)) | `true` |
| `knowledge.auto_ingest_artifact_kinds` | Artifact kinds eligible for auto-ingest. `widget` is excluded as UI rather than a document; `svg` is excluded because the file reader has no support for it | `["markdown", "text", "html", "json"]` |
| `knowledge.auto_add_documents` | Let the agent add documents it reads while working to the Knowledge Library (one aggregate "Auto-added" source). The agent fetches the content with its own tools under your approval; Kiro Crew fetches nothing, so `doc_ingest_hosts` does not apply. Renamed from `auto_ingest_doc_links`, which is still accepted on read | `true` |
| `knowledge.auto_register_project_docs` | Register the documents of each project you work in as a Knowledge source automatically. Documents only (`.md`/`.pdf`/`.docx`/`.org` above a size floor, excluding agent instructions, generated files and repository boilerplate) — never source code | `true` |
| `knowledge.auto_ingest_chunk_budget` | Chunks an automatically-registered source may ingest per watcher sweep. Each chunk is one LLM extraction call, so this bounds the cost; newest documents land first and the rest follow on later sweeps. 0 removes the bound | `150` |
| `knowledge.folder_ingest_chunk_budget` | Chunks a folder you add by hand may ingest per watcher sweep, including the first scan started by confirming the source. Nothing is skipped — newest files land first and the rest continue on later sweeps — so this paces spend rather than limiting what is ingested. Higher than the auto-ingest budget because you asked for the folder explicitly. 0 removes the bound; a per-source `chunk_budget` property overrides it for one folder | `300` |
| `knowledge.dedup_every_n_sweeps` | Run a full duplicate-collapsing pass every Nth watcher sweep (the per-write gate only catches byte-identical documents). 0 disables | `12` |
| `knowledge.auto_discover_folder` | Watch for a documents folder inside the active workspace and register it as a Knowledge source automatically, so files dropped there become searchable without adding the source by hand. The folder is never created for you, and deleting or pausing the auto-added source persists so it does not reappear on the next sweep. Off by default because ingestion spends LLM extraction on every supported file | `false` |
| `knowledge.auto_discover_dirname` | Folder name inside the workspace that auto-discovery looks for. A single path segment: separators and traversal are rejected so the source cannot be redirected outside the workspace. Avoid `knowledge`, which is where the Library's own store lives and always exists | `"knowledge-docs"` |

### Top level

| Key | Description | Default |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `auto_update` | Enable automatic update checks | `true` |
| `timezone` | IANA timezone name, e.g. `"America/Los_Angeles"` | `""` (falls back to UTC) |
| `snapshot_dir` | Where `kirocrew snapshot` writes tarballs | `""` (`~/.kiro/crew/snapshots`) |

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `KIROCREW_HOME` | Override the config/data directory | `~/.kiro/crew` |
| `KIROCREW_PORT` | Override the dashboard port | `5476` |
| `KIROCREW_PROJECT_DIR` | Override the agent-config/skills project directory | Auto-detected |
| `KIROCREW_WORKSPACE` | Override the workspace root, used as-is with no subdirectory appended | Saved `workspace_dir`, else a platform default |
| `KIROCREW_NODE_BIN_DIR` | Override the directory containing Node.js tools for this process | saved `node-bin-dir`, manager scan, then inherited `PATH` |
| `KIROCREW_SKIP_MODEL_DOWNLOAD` | Set to `1` to skip the background embedding-model download at gateway startup (tests, CI, airgapped hosts) | unset |
| `KIROCREW_EMBED_MODEL_URL` | Override HTTPS URL for the embedding-model GGUF; wins over `memory.embed_model_url` and the CDN default | unset |
| `KIROCREW_EMBED_MODEL_PATH` | Absolute path to a local GGUF to use instead of the bundled model; wins over `memory.embed_model_path` and suppresses the default download entirely | unset |

### Timezone

The `timezone` key affects three things:

- the `[CURRENT DATE]` line injected into every LLM prompt, so "today" is not
  ambiguous on a host whose system clock is UTC
- cron schedule display (`kirocrew cron list`, the Slack Home Tab)
- `skip_dates` evaluation for cron jobs

A per-job `timezone` on a cron job wins over this global value.

## Credentials

`~/.kiro/crew/.env` holds messaging-channel credentials and the owner ID. For
Slack:

```
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-...
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
KIROCREW_OWNER_ID=UXXXXXXXX
```

## Denied Commands

The built-in destructive-command deny rules are enforced at Kiro Crew's own
PreToolUse gate, and are on by default. They are configurable from Settings →
Security: you can disable individual rules, disable them all, or add your own
patterns.

That opt-out state is **not** stored in `config.json`. It lives in a trust-root
file the agent itself cannot read or write, which is what makes the ceiling
un-disableable by the agent. An enterprise security policy can force-pin the
rules so they cannot be opted out of at all.

## File Locations
