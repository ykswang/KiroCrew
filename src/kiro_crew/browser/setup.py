    Browser settings save handler) can report progress or an actionable failure
    in its JSON body rather than 500-ing. Steps, in order:

    1. **node** — ensure a usable Node via :func:`kiro_crew.env.ensure_node`
       (bootstraps it through the bundled ``ensure-node.sh`` when absent). Without
       Node nothing else can run, so this returns ``ok=False, step="node"`` with
       an install hint.
    2. **package** — make ``@playwright/mcp`` launchable the SAME way the proxy
       runs it, matching the ecosystem: no ``npm install -g``. Every MCP client
       (Claude Code, Codex, VS Code) launches it via ``npx @playwright/mcp`` — a
       machine-global install is neither recommended nor needed. So:
         - If a launcher already resolves (a standalone binary, ``npx``, or a
           ``KIROCREW_PLAYWRIGHT_CMD`` override), SKIP entirely — nothing to fetch.
         - Otherwise prime the ``npx`` cache with one pinned fetch so first use is
           fast and offline-safe. If neither ``npx`` nor a binary exists (npm-free
           host), FAIL SOFT: the mode still enables and the detail names the Docker
           image and ``KIROCREW_PLAYWRIGHT_CMD`` escape hatches, because a missing
           npm must not block a capability the operator can wire up another way.
    3. **browser** — ``playwright install <engine>`` to fetch the OS/arch browser
       binary; ``chromium`` is always safe, ``firefox``/``webkit`` pull
       Playwright's own builds. Skipped when the package step failed soft (there is
       no resolved launcher/core to provision against yet).

    Blocking (subprocess + network + disk) — MUST run off the event loop
    (``asyncio.to_thread``). Every spawned command inherits a Node-augmented PATH
    so a version-manager Node the daemon did not inherit is still found, and pins

    fail — reporting it usable would mislead. The message is still calm, but it now
    surfaces the ACTUAL cause and a manual fallback so a determined failure (locked
    network, private-registry-only egress, broken npm) is not a dead end:

    - ``reason`` is a SAFE one-line cause from :func:`_sanitize_reason` (an
      allowlisted error-code label, never echoed stderr) or a short exception type
      — shown inline so the operator sees *why*, not a bare "it failed". Empty when
      the failure is unrecognized, in which case the reason clause is omitted.
    - ``manual_command`` is the copy-pasteable command to install it by hand, with
      the public registry pinned so it works from a shell whose ``.npmrc`` points at
      a private mirror. It is a STRUCTURED field (not embedded in the prose) so the
      dashboard renders it as its own ``<code>`` block; the prose just points at it.

    The full raw stderr stays in the log; only the allowlisted label reaches the UI.

    surfaces are converged, keyed by *resolved launch target* (an entry that
    invokes ``mcp-playwright-proxy``) plus KiroCrew's superseded keys:

    1. kiro's ``~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`` — the browse entry KiroCrew
       co-manages — is rewritten to the canonical proxy entry. This also upgrades
       KiroCrew's legacy DIRECT ``npm:@playwright/mcp`` entry (written by installs
       that predate the compression proxy) to the proxy, preserving the original
       boot migration's direct-to-proxy behavior.
    2. KiroCrew's own ``~/.kiro/crew/mcp.json`` — the agent-specific MCP override
       merged into the agent config on every rebuild — is converged at the

       than re-injected on every rebuild for the per-rebuild

    3. The KiroCrew-generated agent configs (the exact filenames in
       ``_OWNED_KIRO_AGENT_FILES`` / ``_OWNED_CC_AGENT_FILES``) are swept so any
       duplicate proxy entry (e.g. a legacy ``playwright-proxy-mcp``) collapses

       machine on a plain gateway restart, without waiting for a full agent
       rebuild. Only the exact files KiroCrew writes are touched — a user's own
       custom agents in the same dirs are never rewritten.

    Never adds Playwright where none exists, never rewrites a user-declared
    server, and never mutates the user-owned discovery sources
    (``~/.claude.json``) — those converge for *display* on read (discovery
    canonicalization) and at launch (pool dedupe), not by mutating files.

    When Browser Mode is OFF, this instead REMOVES the proxy from every Kiro Crew
    surface: registration is the authorization, so a stale proxy left by a prior
